**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no neighbors and my current color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the players not already in my `colors` dictionary. This will allow me to see their color and hopefully find a consensus color to maximize my payoff.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 0 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and cannot see any colors


I should purchase an edge to a neighbor to gather information about their color options. This will help me make an informed decision on my color choice to maximize my payoff, as reaching a consensus is critical for earning a reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared with little time remaining


I should declare my color as '0'. This will give me a projected reward of 3 if a consensus is reached on '0', and I have no information suggesting that there is a disagreement on colors. It is the best option available to maximize my payoff given the circumstances.
