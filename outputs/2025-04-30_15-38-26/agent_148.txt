**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and thus cannot observe any player colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players who currently has a degree of 0 (such as player 749) to gain information about their color. This will help me decide which color to declare and potentially achieve consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only connected neighbor (agent 749) has not declared a color yet


I should wait and see if they choose a color first. This way


I can better determine whether to align with color '0' or '1' based on their decision, maximizing the chance for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only connected player (agent 749) has not yet chosen a color


I need to make a decision quickly. I should declare my color as '1' because it has a higher projected reward (2.97) compared to color '0' (1.97), which may encourage agent 749 to follow suit if they are inclined to choose color '1' as well.
