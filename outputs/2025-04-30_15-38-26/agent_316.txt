**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Given that I am not connected to any players and there are no visible colors


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the players to gather information about their colors. This will help me decide on my color before the time expires. However, with only a few seconds left and no knowledge of their colors


I will have to make a choice quickly; I will purchase an edge to player 749 as my first action to see their color and make a more informed decision.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since the only connected player (749) has not declared a color


I should wait to see if they choose a color in the remaining time, as my current color is undeclared and I can achieve a payoff if we reach consensus. If they declare their color


I can then decide whether to match it or opt for a different strategy based on the potential projected rewards.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and the only connected player (749) has not yet chosen a color


I should declare my color as '1' to maximize my projected reward. This will also encourage player 749 to potentially choose '1' as well, moving towards a consensus before time runs out.
