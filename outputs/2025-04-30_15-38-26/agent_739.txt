**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players in my `colors` dictionary


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the agents to gather information. This will allow me to see their color and make a more informed decision about which color to declare for consensus. I should choose a player with the shortest path distance available, as they are likely to influence the consensus color more effectively.

I should purchase an edge to a player I am not currently connected to in order to gather information about their color and potentially achieve consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connected neighbors and no information about other players' colors. I should purchase an edge to a player (ideally one that is more likely to choose color 1) to gather information and facilitate consensus. Since my connected colors are empty


I will need to take a risk to maximize my payoff before time runs out.
