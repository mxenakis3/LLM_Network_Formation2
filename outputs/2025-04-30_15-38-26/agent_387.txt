**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since there are no connected players


I have no information about their potential choices. I should purchase an edge to one of the players (for example, player 749) to gain insight into their color and increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus. This will help me maximize my potential reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I can only see player 749's color, which is currently undeclared


I should wait for player 749 to choose a color. If they choose 0


I will also choose 0 to achieve consensus and maximize my payout. If they choose 1


I will consider changing my color to 1 as well. With a little time left, it might be best to observe before making any decisions.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and connected to only one player (agent 749) who has not chosen a color yet, my best option is to declare my color as '0'. This way


I can contribute to the consensus on color '0' and maximize my potential payoff even if I can't see the colors of other agents. With time running out


I need to make this decision quickly to avoid receiving zero payoff.
