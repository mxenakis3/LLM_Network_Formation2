**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and therefore cannot see any player's color. I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the players to gather information about their colors. However, since all my potential neighbors have a degree of 0 and are not connected to anyone


I may not get useful information from them. I should wait for a moment to see if the situation updates, as purchasing an edge now might not lead to a guaranteed consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no connected colors


I should purchase an edge to a player who has the potential to join the network and choose a color, in order to improve my chances of reaching consensus and securing a payout. I must evaluate which player has the best connection potential and may influence the outcome positively. Given the lack of current connections


I will choose to purchase an edge.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no visible neighbors


I need to choose a color quickly to ensure that I am part of the consensus. Since choosing color '1' offers a higher potential payout (3 versus 2 for color '0')


I should declare my color as '1' now to maximize my chances of receiving a payout, even without knowing the colors of other players.
