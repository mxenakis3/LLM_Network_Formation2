You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connected neighbors and I am undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the other players to start gathering information about their colors. This will help increase our chances of reaching consensus before time runs out.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since both of my connected neighbors, agents 148 and 387, have not declared their colors yet


I should purchase an edge to a different player not connected to me to potentially gather more information. By doing this


I increase my chances of finding a consensus color that will maximize my payoff before time runs out.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 387:

**Agent**: 
Thought: With only 1.084 seconds remaining and all my connected players having undeclared colors


I should declare color '0' since it offers a higher projected reward of 3, and hope that at least one of my neighbors will also choose '0' to achieve consensus.
