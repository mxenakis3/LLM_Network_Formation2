You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no neighbors to determine the color dynamics, and as my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the other players, as this may provide me with information on their colors and help me reach consensus. Since there are no connected players, my best option is to purchase an edge to an available player to potentially gain a color insight.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to a player who has a degree (connections) of at least 1 to increase my chances of reaching consensus by gaining information about potential colors in the future. I'll choose one of the players with a degree of 1 or more, such as player 749 or player 148, since they are the only options to connect to currently.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have one neighbor (agent 749) with an undeclared color


I should declare my color as "0" because the projected rewards indicate a higher payoff for choosing "0" (2.97) compared to "1" (1.97). This way


I can potentially influence my direct neighbor to adopt the same color, increasing the chance of reaching consensus.
