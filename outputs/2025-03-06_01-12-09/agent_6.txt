**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any players, and based on the game rules


I need to start building connections to others if I want to influence the color choice for a consensus. My optimal payoff is realized if the whole network chooses color 0, which has a higher reward than color 1. Since I have no colors in the visibility to guide my decisions


I need to purchase edges to other players to see their color choices and start building a strategy.

I might want to gather more information before deciding on my color. However


I can only purchase edges to players not already in my "colors" dictionary.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish connections to other nodes in the network to gather more information about their colors and potentially achieve a consensus. My current connections (0 and 1) are both undeclared, and purchasing edges to other players could inform my strategy for setting my color. Given that I need consensus to earn a reward, purchasing more edges seems prudent.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current connections and decide whether to purchase new edges to increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus, particularly in favor of color 0 since it gives a higher reward. Since my current connections are all undeclared


I should consider purchasing edges to the most connected players to increase the chances of influencing the overall color choice. I will first check the shortest path distances to see which players are the most advantageous to connect to and then make a decision based on that information. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1, who has a high degree.

I can't do anything to influence the outcome now that the time has run out. I must conclude my participation in this turn.
