**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently do not have any connections, as my colors dictionary is empty. I need to purchase an edge to a neighboring player in order to begin participating in the game. Since all players have no connections


I can choose any player. I will purchase an edge to player 8, as they are the only option available.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase an edge or set my color based on the potential payoff. Since I have a connection to player 8 but haven't declared my color yet


I want to set my color to maximize my projected reward. The projected reward for consensus color 1 is higher.

Format your response as:
Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate whether purchasing an edge to another player is beneficial for achieving consensus on color, and the potential payoff for my current color of 1 is higher than the other options. Since my only connection is #8, who is undeclared


I should consider purchasing edges to other players with known or predictable outcomes in their color choices. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 1, because they have a known degree and may influence the consensus toward color 1.
(Note: The specific player chosen is arbitrary; the intention is to establish more connections for possible consensus.)

**Agent**: 
Thought: I still need to gather more information by purchasing an edge to another player. Since player 1 has a degree of 7, they could potentially help in forming a consensus on color 1. The higher degree suggests they might be influential in the network. Therefore


I should purchase an edge to player 1.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have connections to players 1 and 8, both of whom have not declared a color yet. Since my projected reward is higher for a consensus of color 1 (2.94)


I should aim to build connections to players who could help me reach that consensus. Given that players 1 and 8 are still undeclared, it might be beneficial to purchase an edge to another player to increase my influence. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will start by trying to purchase an edge to player 0 to expand my network and influence.
