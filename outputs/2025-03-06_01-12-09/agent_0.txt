**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections and cannot see any colors. To potentially achieve a consensus


I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player in the network. Since all players have a degree of 0


I will need to buy an edge to any player I can reach, so I will select one to purchase a connection to. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I choose to connect to player 1 as they are the next available player.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have connections to players 1, 4, and 5, and none of them have declared their colors yet. To increase my chances of reaching a consensus


I should either purchase edges to other players or wait to see the colors of my current connections. However, since all my current connections are undecided, purchasing additional connections may help me gather more information and potentially influence the network’s color choice. My current projected reward for consensus is better when choosing color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2, who is currently not connected to me, to understand their color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to secure a higher projected payoff by either getting more players to declare their colors or purchasing edges to connect with players whose colors I can see. Since I have connections with several players who have not declared their colors, it might be more beneficial to purchase edges to obtain information about others' colors. 
Action: purchase_edge(3) 
(Note: Player 3 has a degree of 1, meaning they might not have many edges but could potentially yield useful information.)

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have several neighbors whose colors are still undeclared, which means I have the potential to influence the network's choice of color. I want to maximize my payoff, which currently favors a consensus for color 0. It would be helpful to increase my connectedness to see more colors, ideally influencing the decision toward color 0. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 0 is higher than for 1


I should strategize to move the network in that direction. I should purchase edges to other players who are not currently my connections to gather more information. 
Action: purchase_edge(7)  # I will purchase an edge to player 7 who is less connected and may not have declared a color.
