**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections (the colors dictionary is empty), which means I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player in order to see their color and potentially influence the game's outcome. Since I am agent 4 and the only player I can connect to is 0


I will purchase an edge to player 0.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to determine whether to purchase an edge to another player or commit to a color. Since I only have one connection with player 0, and their color is still undeclared


I will consider purchasing an edge to another player to gather more information. The potential reward for a consensus of color 0 is higher than for color 1, so I should prioritize that. Looking at the shortest path information


I can purchase edges to player 1 or potentially other players with shorter paths. Since I only know player 0's status


I will purchase an edge to player 1 to see their color.

I should consider purchasing edges to increase my connections and potentially influence the consensus towards color 0.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I observe that I have connections to agents 0, 1, and 2, all of whom have not declared a color yet. The potential payoffs for a consensus are better when more agents choose color 0, thus I should try to encourage consensus towards that color. Since I have no declared color


I need to consider purchasing connections to increase my visibility in the network. I can buy edges to agents 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. However, agents with colors that are not visible yet are less useful right now. I will consider connecting with agent 3, who has a degree of 3 and is one step away from me, as this could potentially bring more connections into my visibility.
