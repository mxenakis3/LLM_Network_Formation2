**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connections to any other agents in the network, and since my colors dictionary is empty


I need to buy an edge to connect with another player. This will allow me to see the colors of that player and make a decision on which color to choose for a better projected reward. I have options 0 and 1 as colors. I will purchase an edge to player 0, as it will expand the number of connections available to me.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have connections to players 7 and 0, both of whom have not yet declared their colors. I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players to increase my chances of achieving a consensus, or to set my color now. Since I currently have a better projected payoff with a consensus of color 0


I should consider purchasing an edge to a player that is further connected to the network to see if that helps achieve consensus. I can see players 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as potential targets for new connections. However, player 1 has only 2 connections and player 2 has 2, while player 3, 4, 5, and 6 have lower degrees or are not connected. I will prioritize purchasing connections to players with low shortest path distances.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to increase my chances of achieving a consensus for color 0, as my projected reward for color 0 is higher than for color 1. I currently see one connection that has declared color 1 (player 7), while players 0 and 1 are still undeclared, meaning they might select color 0 or 1. I should purchase edges to players who might contribute to a consensus if they choose color 0, particularly those that are closer in the shortest path distance.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide on the best action to increase my chances of achieving a consensus with my network. Since my projected reward for consensus of 0 is higher than that for consensus of 1


I should aim to persuade my connected players to choose color 0. I currently have two connections that are undeclared, so I should purchase more edges to other players to influence their color choice.
