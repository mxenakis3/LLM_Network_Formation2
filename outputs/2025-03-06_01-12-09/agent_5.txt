**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no current connections in the network and cannot see any colors. I need to strategically purchase edges to connect with other agents to gather information about their colors. The other agents have degrees and shortest path distances of infinity, meaning they are not directly connected to me. Since I currently have no information


I should purchase an edge to one of the other agents to better understand the network.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have a single connection with agent 0, whose color is undeclared. My best projected reward is with color 1 at 2.97. I should assess whether I need to buy additional connections to other players to influence the game's outcome or simply set my color to 1. Since agent 0's color is still undeclared


I need to consider purchasing additional edges to see other players' colors. Players 1, 4, and 5 are potential candidates for additional edges, as I am connected to them via my current connections. I will prioritize player 1 since they are nearest and can impact consensus.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate the potential payoff of setting my color to either 0 or 1, but I also have the opportunity to purchase edges to other players to gather more information about their colors. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for a consensus of 0


I should consider reaching out to players who could potentially be encouraged to also select color 1. I need to see if I can gather more connections or information by purchasing edges. The players I am currently connected to have undeclared colors, so I might want to buy edges to players who are closer in the shortest path distances and could influence my decision. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2 who is at distance 2.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase new connections or set my color based on the projected rewards for consensus. Right now


I have connections with agents 0, 1, and 2, who have not yet declared colors. Consensus for color 1 seems more promising since the projected reward is higher than for color 0. However


I should consider if purchasing connections could provide me with more information to make a better decision.
Action: purchase_edge(3) 
(Note: I will purchase a connection to agent 3, who could potentially declare a color that influences the consensus.)
