Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections, and the shortest path distances indicate that I'm isolated with no available edges to purchase. To gain a better position and potentially form a consensus


I need to purchase an edge to a neighboring agent. However, all nodes have a degree of 0 and appear unreachable. Therefore


I should consider purchasing any available edge to connect to another player. 
Action: purchase_edge(3)  # Since I can only connect to myself


I’ll purchase an edge where I am connected to an existing node, which is not possible, but I'll assume it signifies I’m connected to myself as a starting point.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to yourself. As a reminder, you are agent 3. You can already read your color information, it is Undeclared:

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have one connection (agent 2) whose color is undeclared. Since I have the option to see this agent's color after the next turn


I should purchase an edge to connect to other agents who might already have declared their colors, increasing the overall visibility and potential for forming a consensus. Given the state of the game, buying edges to other agents with known connections would be beneficial. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to agent 1 to increase my connections and gain visibility on their color in the next turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players or set my color. I currently can see the colors of players 1 and 2, both of whom have not declared their color. Since I have two undeclared connections, the potential for a consensus is still open. However, my projected reward for consensus of 1 is higher. I should consider purchasing edges to other players to gather more information about colors before making a decision on my own color.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to player 0 as they are in the network.

Thought: I can see that all my connections have not yet declared their colors. Therefore, it would be beneficial to purchase an edge to another player to increase my visibility of the state of the network. Since I have a higher projected reward for a consensus of color 1


I should strategically target someone who can help me confirm my choice or lead me towards a consensus.
