Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections in the network, so I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player and gather information about their color. Since I can see that all nodes except for myself are at a distance of "inf," it indicates they are not directly reachable. However, since my degree is 0


I will need to make a strategic decision on the first connection. There are no colors known to me right now. I will look to purchase an edge to one of the players, starting with the player with ID 3.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to make a decision on whether to purchase additional edges or set my color. Currently, my projected payoff for consensus on color 0 is better than for color 1. However, my connections with other players are not committed to a color yet, as both of them are undeclared. I should consider purchasing an edge to increase my chances of seeing more colors in the next round, especially since I have only a limited time to act. The players I could potentially connect to, based on my shortest path distances, are 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. I will evaluate which of these has the highest degree, as connecting to a player with more connections might yield better results.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my connections and the current colors of my neighbors. I see that I have three neighbors, all of whom are still undeclared. I need to pick a color and potentially reach out to more players, but I need to decide based on the current projected rewards. If I set my color to 0


I can still get a decent reward, but I need a consensus to secure it. I need to take an action that helps establish a consensus. It might be beneficial to purchase more edges to connect with additional players who might declare color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(4) 
(Note: I'm choosing to purchase an edge to neighbor 4 because they are at distance 2, and increasing the number of players I can observe could help in making a more informed decision for setting my color.)
