Thought: I currently have no existing connections as indicated by the empty colors dictionary. To maximize my potential payoffs


I should purchase an edge to a neighboring player. This will allow me to see the colors of my connections in the next turn and work towards achieving a consensus. Since all players seem to have a shortest path distance marked as 'inf,' I should start by purchasing an edge to any player I can connect with—specifically player 14, if available.

I should keep my options open. I could purchase edges to players with higher degrees to potentially help sway the network towards color 0 if more players join. However


I should also consider setting my own color now to align with potential support for color 0 since it offers the highest projected payoff. Given that all colors are currently undecided, it might be wise to first purchase connections to players with higher degrees, which may increase my chances of forming consensus around color 0 in the upcoming turns.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide on my color based on the current payoff projections, while considering my connections. I see that several of my connections have already declared color 1, and only one has declared color 0. This suggests that a consensus around color 1 is more likely. However, my projected reward for a consensus of 0 is currently higher. My main concerns are whether I can connect with more players and if I want to risk declaring a color now. Given that my projected reward for consensus of 0 is more significant


I might consider making more connections to see if I can flip more players to color 0.

Thought: I need to evaluate the colors of my connections and decide whether to purchase new edges or set my color. I see that there are players who have declared their color and I have some that are 'undeclared'. Consensus on color 0 yields a higher reward than color 1, but my connections show mixed colors. It's crucial to either strengthen my network for consensus on 0 or set my color strategically. With the projected rewards leaning more favorably towards consensus on color 0, it might be beneficial to purchase edges to see more players’ colors before making a final decision.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current situation in the game to decide whether to purchase new edges or set my color. I currently have several connections of varying colors, some of which are undeclared. Since consensus is important for maximizing my payoff


I should determine if I should secure more connections or set my color based on what I know of my neighbors.
Observation: Based on my colored neighbors


I see that I have many connections declaring color '1' and some that are '0'. However, my projected reward is higher for a consensus of '0'. My immediate choices are to try and make sure I can secure edges to influence the game towards a consensus of '0'.
Action: I will purchase an edge to one of the players with an undeclared color to potentially influence their choice. I will choose to purchase the edge to player 6, as they are currently undeclared.

Thought: I need to determine if I should purchase edges to connect with other players or commit to a color based on the current colors of my connections.
