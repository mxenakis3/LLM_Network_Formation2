Thought: I have no existing connections and no visibility into the colors of other players. Since I can only purchase edges to connect with other players and increase my visibility


I should start by purchasing a connection to one of the players. All players have a degree of 0, and my shortest path distances indicate that I can only connect to player 10 or other players that become accessible through a purchase. I will start by purchasing an edge to a player with ID 0 to begin building my network.

I may miss the opportunity for a consensus payoff. My projected reward for a consensus of color 0 is higher than for color 1.

The nearest players (based on the shortest path) are nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 12. It would make sense to purchase edges to these players to understand the network better.
