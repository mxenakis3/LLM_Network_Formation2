**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to other players in the network, as indicated by the empty colors dictionary. Therefore


I need to purchase an edge to a player in order to start interacting with others. Since I cannot see any declared colors, any edge I buy will allow me to see the color of the player I connect to in the next turn. The players available to connect to are those that have a shortest path distance listed and are not in my colors dictionary. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 0 since it is the first available neighbor and is not in my colors dictionary.

Thought: I still have no connections to other players, so I need to purchase an edge to start connecting with the network. Since I can see the degrees of the nodes now, it would be wise to connect to a player that has a higher degree, as they will likely have more connections and possibly influence the consensus. Player 0 has a degree of 8, indicating that they might be a good connection point.

I should investigate if purchasing edges is beneficial to increase my potential payoff for a consensus. My projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0, so I might consider encouraging more players to choose color 1. Since there are multiple players that I can connect to and whose colors may influence the consensus


I will purchase an edge to potentially gain more information and possibly secure more favorable colors for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for a consensus of 0, so I should consider setting my color to 1. However


I also need to assess my current connections; some agents have already declared their colors (1), while others remain undeclared. I might want to purchase edges to those players who might strengthen my position toward achieving consensus for color 1. I will prioritize purchasing connections to those who are currently undeclared as they may be persuaded.

Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players or set my color based on the information I have. I see that several of my connections have already declared their colors (some as '1' and some as '0'). Since the potential payoff for a consensus on color 1 is higher than on color 0


I should consider what my connections are favoring. If I encounter more players leaning toward color 1 after purchasing some edges


I will set my color accordingly. The current connections I have show a mix of colors, and some are undeclared. I should purchase edges to players who are currently undeclared to gather more information.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current position in the game. My connections show a mix of colors with the majority leaning towards color 1. The projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than that for color 0. However


I have several connections that are still undeclared which could change the dynamics. I know that purchasing edges could allow me to connect with more players and potentially sway the consensus without a hefty price, so I should explore that option. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to one of the undeclared connections to potentially gain more influence over the network's consensus. I'll start with player 10. 
(Note: Since I can't see the player's connection state


I'm proceeding with a reasonable choice based on available information.)
