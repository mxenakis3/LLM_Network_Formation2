Purchasing edges will allow me to connect with other agents, which may help in determining which color to choose later.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to analyze the current state of the network and my available actions. I have two connections (3 and 5) that are undeclared, which means they haven't chosen a color yet. My goal is to promote the consensus of color 0, as it provides a higher potential payoff. To increase the chances of reaching consensus, it might be beneficial to purchase an edge to a player who can potentially contribute to the color 0 consensus or declare my color as 0 if I believe I can influence the other players. Since my connections are also undeclared, it may be strategic to wait and see what color they choose. I will purchase an edge to player 1 (who has a low degree) to see if they declare color 0, increasing overall consensus potential.

I should look to solidify this path. Purchasing connections will provide me with further information on other players’ colors.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: Since there are no remaining seconds in the game


I cannot perform any further actions. My current color is set to 0, and I need to hope for a consensus to maximize my reward. The projected reward for color 0 is 2.88, which is favorable compared to color 1's 1.88. However, the game has concluded, so I cannot take any additional actions.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game has concluded, as there are negative seconds remaining. My current color is 0, and I have a projected reward of 2.88 if color 0 is chosen by the network. The colors of my connections show that several have committed to color 1, while a few have their colors undeclared, including two players who are currently marked as color 0. I cannot take any further actions since the game time has elapsed. It is now a waiting game to see if there was a consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game has ended since there are negative seconds remaining. My current color is 0, and my projected reward for a consensus of 0 is 2.88, which is significantly better than the 1.88 for color 1. However, since I cannot make any further moves and must wait to see the final outcome


I have to hope that the network reached a consensus for color 0.
