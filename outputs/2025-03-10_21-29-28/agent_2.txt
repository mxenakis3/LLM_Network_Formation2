I should assess my options. Keeping in mind that purchasing an edge costs 0.03 from my projected payoff


I need to consider whether it's beneficial to wait for the color declarations from my current connections or to purchase more edges to establish new connections. Right now, my potential payoff is highest with a consensus of color 0, provided I can encourage more players to vote for it.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have connections to players 0, 1, and 3, all of whom have not declared their colors yet. My best payoff comes from a consensus of color 0, which I should aim for. Given that I can see the colors of my connections after their declarations, my best action would be to wait and see if any of these players declare a color that aligns with color 0. However, since my connections are all "undeclared," it might be beneficial to purchase additional edges to players I don't yet connect with, particularly those who might lean towards color 0 or those with higher degrees that can influence the outcome further.
Given that my projected reward for 0 is near the threshold for significant gain


I will assess the situation and consider purchasing an edge if it is advantageous. 
Among the potential neighbors I can purchase edges to are nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Players with higher degrees might be a better investment.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to assess my position in the game. I currently control color 0, but I see that the majority of my visible connections have chosen color 1. Since setting color 1 will give me a higher projected payoff when consensus is reached, especially with several players leaning toward 1


I must consider buying edges to connect with more players. With my projected reward for consensus of 0 being higher but not the leading color


I should analyze the situation further. I can either try to convince more players to switch to color 0 or ensure I broaden my connections to identify more players' colors. However, since the majority seems to favor color 1


I may need to consider switching to color 1 for a better payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current position and determine if purchasing edges will increase my chances of reaching a consensus of color 0. Setting my color to 0 might also help, but I need to observe the colors of my neighbors to make an informed decision. Since several of my neighbors have "undeclared" colors, purchasing additional edges to see more connections may be beneficial. I will prioritize purchasing edges to agents with high degrees, given they are likely to influence the consensus decision.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game is nearing its end, and I need to make a decisive move that maximizes my potential payoff. Currently, a consensus on color 0 would yield a higher payoff than color 1. Since many of my neighbors have "undeclared" colors


I should purchase edges to gather more information about their color choices, especially since I have limited time left in the game. The most strategic move would be to purchase edges to players with "undeclared" colors in hopes that they will vote for color 0. I will purchase an edge to either agent 6 or 7, as neither of them has declared a color yet.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, which means I cannot make any further moves. I must evaluate the situation based on the colors of my connections. Currently


I see that the consensus for color 0 projects a payoff of approximately 2.91, while color 1 projects a payoff of about 1.91. Given that some of my connections have declared color 1, it is likely that I will not win any money if the game ends without a consensus. However


I no longer have options to influence the outcome by purchasing edges or changing my color. The game is effectively over for me now.

I recognize that my highest projected payoff for a consensus of color 0 is still significantly better than for color 1.
