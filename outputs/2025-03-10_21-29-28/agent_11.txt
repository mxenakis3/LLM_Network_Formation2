Thought: I currently have no connections in the network, which means I can't see any colors of other players. To participate in the game and increase my chances of earning a payoff


I should purchase an edge to connect with another player. Given that all players have a degree of 0 and the shortest path distances show I'm only connected to myself (which results in no visible colors)


I can attempt to buy a connection to any player. I will choose to purchase an edge to player 12, as it is the next available player in the network.

I should focus on purchasing edges to see the colors of more players. Since I can connect to nodes that I can reach (degree and shortest path)


I will consider purchasing edges to node 1, which has a decent degree and could provide more information in the next turn.

I'll consider purchasing edges to players with high degrees to increase my visibility of their colors. Players 0 and 1 are already connected, but I can connect to others like player 2, who has a degree of 5 and is only two steps away from me. This connection could provide valuable insights.

I should consider the potential reactions of other players and whether I should purchase edges to see more color declarations or go ahead and set my color. I have a higher projected reward for consensus on color 1, so I need to either mimic that choice or ensure I have more information.
