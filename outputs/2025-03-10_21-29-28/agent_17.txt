Thought: I don't have any existing connections in the network and need to buy edges to other agents to maximize my projected payoff. I should purchase an edge to one of the other players to check their colors and make an informed decision on my next move. Since all players have a degree of 0 and are unreachable


I must select a neighbor based on the shortest path distance. The only reachable player is agent 17, which indicates that I can only connect to myself. Therefore


I will purchase an edge to the agent with the lowest ID that I can connect to (which is agent 0, as I need to connect to at least one of them).

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to determine a strategy to maximize my projected reward in the game. Currently


I see that I have connections with players 0, 1, 2, and 16, all of whom are undeclared. The projected rewards indicate that a consensus on color 1 will yield a higher payoff than color 0. However, to influence the network for a consensus on color 1


I need to encourage more players to select that color. 
Since I am already connected to multiple undeclared players


I should consider purchasing additional edges to gain connections with more players. This would increase my visibility into their colors and potentially allow me to secure a higher projected payoff by successfully creating a consensus for color 1.

Thought: I have observed that I have connections to players with some declaring their colors and others remaining undeclared. Currently, my projected reward for consensus on color 1 is higher compared to color 0, and I see two other players who have chosen color 1. The best strategy seems to be purchasing edges to reach out to more players and find out their declared colors, particularly those who might also choose color 1 to improve my chances of forming a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(9)  # I will purchase an edge to player 9 since they have connections and might provide useful information on the next turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that my connections have a mix of declared colors, with some still undecided. The consensus for color 1 is higher than for color 0, so I should aim to support color 1. I could secure more connections to convince undecided players to choose 1. I need to purchase an edge to one of the agents who has not declared, starting from the nodes with the highest degree.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I notice that I have multiple connections whose colors are declared, and I'm leaning towards a consensus of color 1 since I have more connections of that color. My projected reward for consensus of 1 is higher than for 0. However, there are still some connections that are undeclared. I can either set my color to 1 now or purchase edges to connect with more players who are undeclared in hopes that they pick color 1. Since buying connections will allow me to see their colors next turn


I should purchase connections to maximize my chances for consensus. 
Considering I am currently connected to players 16 and several others with undeclared colors


I will work on connecting to more players to gather better information. Since I would like to maximize my chances of reaching a consensus for color 1


I will purchase an edge to another player.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide how to play my turn based on the colors of my connections and the projected rewards for each consensus. Currently


I can see that several players are connected to me and have declared their colors. The consensus for color 1 has a higher projected reward than color 0, so I need to evaluate whether it's better for me to buy edges to see more players or to set my color to 1. 
I notice that players 1, 3, 5 have set their color to 1, and players 2 and 4 have set their color to 0. Given that my projected reward is higher for the consensus of color 1


I may want to connect with other players who have not yet declared their color to potentially sway the consensus.
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 6, as they are undeclared and currently not in my colors dictionary. 
(Note: Assuming the cost of purchasing an edge does not detract from the action at this moment, as I am currently focused on determining the potential for consensus.)
