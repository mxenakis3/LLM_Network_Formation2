I need to purchase edges to gather more information about other players, which may help me determine the optimal strategy. Since I currently have connections to players with IDs 0, 2, and 5


I should consider which player to connect to next to increase my chances of winning. Players 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 are options based on my shortest path distance. Given that my maximum projected payoff for color 1 is higher


I want to explore connections that can help me confirm that most players will lean towards color 1.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current color and the colors of my connections to decide if I should purchase new edges or wait for the next refresh to see the colors of my current connections. Currently


I have a higher projected payoff if the consensus is for color 1 (2.94), and I already have one connection (agent 3) that picked color 1. I have a total of 17 connections available, and many of my current connections still have undeclared colors. Purchasing edges may help me gain more information and potentially reach a consensus, but I need to be strategic about it.
Action: I will purchase an edge to one of my neighbors with an undeclared color, as it may help me secure more information before the next turn. I will choose to purchase an edge to player 4, who currently has color '0'.
(Note: This is a hypothetical action based on my thought process; in an actual game


I would choose any neighbor that is not connected and has an undeclared color that fits my strategy.)

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have enough information about the colors of my connections. The projected payoff for picking color 1 is higher than for color 0, and I currently have connections that have declared both colors. However, there's a potential risk with connections that are undeclared. I should consider purchasing edges to players who might declare color 1 after this turn. 
Action: purchase_edge(8) 
(Note: I'm suggesting to purchase an edge to player 8 because they are undeclared and close to my connections, which may increase the likelihood of consolidating around color 1.)

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have some connections with different colors visible, and my projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than that for color 0. Since I have already set my color to 1


I should try to ensure that more players also choose color 1 to reach consensus. There are several players with undeclared colors, which I can connect with. Purchasing edges will allow me to see their colors in the next turn, possibly increasing the number of players supporting color 1. 
Action: I will purchase edges to some players who have undeclared colors to potentially convince them to choose color 1. Let's start by purchasing an edge to player 10.
