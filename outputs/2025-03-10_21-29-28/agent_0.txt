Thought: I currently have no connections and I need to make a move to increase my chances of forming a consensus. Since all nodes (including myself) are currently isolated with no declared colors


I should purchase an edge to a player to establish a connection. This will help me gain information about other players' colors in the next turn. Considering that all player connections have the same degree of zero


I can choose any player to connect with.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I have several connections (7, 12, 5, 1) but all of their colors are currently undeclared. My maximum projected payoff is higher if the network reaches a consensus on color 0 (2.97 vs. 1.97 for color 1). Since I cannot see the colors of other players who are not directly connected


I might need to purchase edges to get more information or influence their decisions. Given that my projected payoff is penalized when purchasing edges but can increase my chances of consensus


I should consider buying an edge to a player with a degree of 1 (like 2, 3, or 4) to see their color.

I need to either encourage more connections or set my color to 0 if I believe that enough of my connections will also go for it. However, all players currently are undeclared. I should assess if purchasing edges to nearby players (who are not currently in my colors dictionary) would be beneficial and potentially help achieve a consensus. The degree information suggests that several connections are available, but I need to be prudent about my projected payoff.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to analyze the colors of my connections and decide whether to purchase edges to improve my chances of achieving a consensus. Currently


I have connections with some agents that have declared colors (agent 1 and agent 3 are both '1', agent 4 is '0'), but many others are undeclared. Given the majority leaning towards color '1'


I should consider purchasing edges to other players to potentially influence them to choose '0', ensuring a higher payoff. My current reward for a consensus of '0' is significantly higher than for '1', so I should prioritize building connections. 
Action: purchase_edge(4)  # I will purchase an edge to player 4, who has committed to color '0'.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have a mix of colors among my connections and two nodes that are currently undecided. There are more players with color 1 than color 0. To maximize my projected payoff


I should try to extend my connections to gauge more players' colors and influence the consensus. Thus


I will purchase an edge to one of the players who are undecided.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate whether I should purchase edges to increase my visibility of other players' colors or set my color now. Currently


I see multiple players with the color '1', which could lead to a consensus for that color, but my payoff for '0' is higher. I should consider buying edges to players with 'None' to better assess the situation before deciding on my color.
