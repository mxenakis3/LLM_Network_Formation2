**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current situation. I have the colors of some of my connections, and I see that colors 1 and 0 are already represented in the network. The majority of my visible colors seem to indicate that players are leaning towards color 1, but I have some players still undeclared. With my projected rewards for consensus being better for color 0


I should consider purchasing connections to find out more about other players’ colors to potentially influence the consensus towards 0. However


I need to spend 0.03 for each edge I want to buy, so I need to be strategic. I will purchase an edge to a player I think may lean towards color 0 to increase my chances. 
Action: purchase_edge(8)  # I will choose an undeclared player to connect to, for strategic purposes.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to assess the current color landscape in the game. The majority of my connected players are leaning towards color 1, but I also see some players with color 0 and quite a few that are undeclared. My projected reward for consensus of color 0 is significantly higher than color 1. I need to make a strategic move to either purchase an edge or set my own color. Since I already have some connections registering colors


I'll choose to purchase an edge to connect with an undeclared player to increase my chances of influencing a consensus towards color 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to make a decision on whether to purchase an edge to connect with more players or set my color. The current majority color among my connections appears to be 1, but I also have players committed to 0. Given that I can still purchase connections for a better consensus


I should consider buying an edge to a neighbor to enhance my visibility of colors and potentially sway the outcome in my favor.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, and I need to make a decision quickly. My connections indicate that the majority is leaning towards color 1, while I have two connections set to color 0. Given the current projected rewards, a consensus of 0 still earns me a decent payoff, but I need to make a decision before the game ends. I should set my color to 0 to align with my connections that are committed to that color, which may help in achieving the consensus.
