Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges to connect with more players or set my color based on the current colors observed. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher


I should aim to align with players who have already selected color 1. There are players with color 1 (5, 1, 3) that I can potentially connect with. However


I also have many connections that are undeclared. I could purchase an edge to an undeclared player to increase my chances of securing a consensus for 1.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide how to play the game based on the current situation. I see that my projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0, and I have more connections that are leaning towards color 1 based on the values in my colors dictionary. I should evaluate whether to purchase additional edges to gather more information or set my color to 1 to push for consensus. However, since many neighbors have undeclared colors, purchasing connections might help me solidify my strategy. I'll focus on purchasing connections to players whose colors I cannot see yet.
Action: purchase_edge(7)  # This is the ID of a new connection I am going to purchase since I don't know their color yet.
