I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player. Since all players have the same degree


I should buy an edge to any player since they all have 0 degree and are effectively isolated. I will need to pick a neighbor to connect to.

I should consider purchasing an edge to other players if they have declared color 0, as that would increase the chances of reaching consensus for color 0. However, since I have to think strategically about the declaration of agent 17 and my connections


I will first determine if I should declare my color or purchase an edge to understand more of the network. Given that my maximum projected reward is higher for color 0 and agent 17 might influence this


I should purchase an edge to a player that may be beneficial.

Thought: I need to decide how to maximize my projected payoff based on the current colors of my connections and the possible edge purchases. There are currently several undeclared connections, and I need to either wait for them to declare or consider purchasing new edges to increase my visibility into the network. Picking color 0 seems more promising given the higher projected payoff for that consensus. However


I need to assess if there's a chance for consensus first.
Action: I will purchase edges to any undeclared players to maximize my visibility; I can purchase edges to players 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 since they are at a distance of 2 from me. I will prioritize those with fewer connections to improve my chance of reaching a consensus. I'll start by purchasing an edge to player 4.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have information on the colors of some of my direct connections, and I can see that the color of some players is still undeclared. I want to maximize my payoff, so I should consider purchasing edges to players to gather more information about their colors and possibly influence the consensus towards color 0, which offers a higher payoff. 
I see that I have already established connections with agents 1 (who chose color 1), 2, 3 (who chose color 1), 4 (who chose color 0), and several others who are still undeclared. I should prioritize purchasing edges to agents who might increase the likelihood of achieving consensus for color 0, especially since color 0 currently has a higher projected payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see that some of my connections are either declared with colors or still undeclared. I need to maximize my payoff, and currently, the consensus for color 0 has a higher projected reward than color 1. I should purchase edges to players who are undeclared and have a degree of 17, as they are more connected and might help reach consensus. I can see that none of my neighbors that are connected to me have declared their color yet. I will first check my options.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate the current colors of my connections to decide whether I should purchase new edges or set my color. The projected payoff for consensus on color 0 is higher than for color 1, so aligning with color 0 might be beneficial. However


I have many undeclared connections which might provide more information. I should consider purchasing at least one edge to another player to see if they will support color 0.

Since the potential payoff for a consensus of color 0 is higher than that for color 1 and I currently have several connections with color 0


I need to prioritize either securing additional connections to players who may support color 0 or declaring my own color to align with them.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I should evaluate my current connections and colors. My rewards for choosing color 0 are higher than for color 1. Additionally, many of my connections are undeclared. Since my best chance seems to lie in forming a consensus towards color 0


I need to assess the possibility of connecting to more players who might also favor color 0. 
My current connections (17, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 15, 10) indicate that some players are already supporting different colors. To influence others


I should look to purchase edges and potentially reveal new connections that might support color 0.
Action: I will purchase edges to several of the undeclared players first, as I might gain information from them, which could help infer a strategy towards a consensus.
