**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have only one connection (node 0) that is undeclared. Based on the degrees and shortest path distances


I should consider purchasing edges to other nodes to gather more information about their colors. This might help in deciding how to color myself for the highest potential payoff. Nodes that are connected (degree > 0) include nodes 1, 5, and 7. They all have a distance of 1 or 2 from me, and I should prioritize purchasing an edge to one of them. Since node 5 and 7 are both degree 1, purchasing an edge to node 5 seems beneficial as it will not cost too much and may give me more visibility into the network colors.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide on a strategy to maximize my payoff. The current connections show a mix of colors among the players, with a good number of agents yet to declare. The consensus for color 0 has a higher projected reward (2.76) compared to color 1 (1.76). Since my color is undeclared


I should also consider purchasing connections to more agents to increase the chances of forming a consensus. I see multiple agents with undeclared colors, and it might be beneficial to connect to one of them to gather more information. 
Action: purchase_edge(8)  # This will connect me to player 8, who is currently undeclared.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see some colors of my connections, and I have connections with players who are split between colors 0 and 1. If I set my color to 0


I have a potential payoff of 3 if the network can reach consensus, which may be achievable since there are players like 2 and 4 who are already at color 0. However


I still have undetermined connections and could potentially increase my influence by purchasing an edge to a player. I need to evaluate if purchasing an edge will strengthen my position.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to analyze my current connections and their colors to determine the best strategy for maximizing my payoff. Currently


I see that there are more players (4) who have declared color 1 than those who have declared color 0 (3). Purchasing additional edges could help me reach more players and influence the consensus. However


I need to be mindful of my projected rewards associated with each consensus. Since I have a lower projected reward for color 1


I should lean towards influencing more players to color 0. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to one of the players that I am currently not connected to in order to increase my visibility into their color decisions. 
I will choose to purchase an edge to player 9 (degree 15, shortest path distance 2) since I currently have no knowledge of their color.

Thought: I see that there are a number of colors already committed among my connected players, with a majority selecting color 1. Since my projected reward for a consensus of color 0 is greater than that for color 1


I need to shift the balance by either convincing my current connections to switch to 0 or by purchasing new edges to players that may also favor color 0. I need to strengthen my position by purchasing connections that can help tilt the consensus towards color 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have connections with some players, and many of them have declared their colors. There's a slightly larger focus on color 1 among my connections. If I don't purchase more connections to gain more information


I risk not reaching a consensus. However


I should weigh the cost of buying connections against the potential payoff. Since I need to reach consensus to earn money


I will prioritize purchasing an edge to a player that has not declared their color yet, particularly since I have a majority in color 1 among my connections.
