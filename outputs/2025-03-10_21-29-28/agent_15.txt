Thought: Since I have no existing connections (the colors dictionary is empty)


I need to purchase an edge to another player to gain visibility of their colors and potentially form a consensus. Since I can see that all neighbors (0 to 17) have an infinite shortest path distance except for myself (15), the only logical step is to make connections with one of the neighbors. I will choose to purchase an edge to one of the neighbors, say 0, since all players currently have no other information.

I will get 1.91, and for color 1

Thought: I currently have connections with players who have declared colors, which are 1, 0, and several undeclared. I could benefit from purchasing connections to players with undeclared colors to try to influence the consensus in my favor. My projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for a consensus of 0, so I should aim for more players to select color 1. My next step will be to purchase an edge to one of the players with an undeclared color to gain more information.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide on the best strategy to maximize my projected reward. I see that there is a consensus forming around color 1 (due to player 1 and player 3's color), which provides a better payoff than color 0. However, there are several players with undeclared colors, and I still could potentially influence their decision. I need to connect with more players to gain better insight into their colors and potentially sway the outcome in favor of color 1.
