Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, and all players are undeclared. To increase my chances of achieving a consensus and maximizing my payoff


I should start by purchasing an edge to any other player. Since every player has a degree of 0 and my distance to player 4 is infinite


I will purchase an edge to player 3, as it is the only available action I can take. After that


I can observe how the network changes and decide on setting my color accordingly.

I am better off purchasing an edge to another player to gather more information. The decision between colors will depend on their choices. Therefore

I can see that if all select color 1


I would get a higher projected payoff than color 0. Since I have time remaining and the potential for higher payoff is better for color 1, it might be wise to buy connections to more players to see their colors.

Some of my connections have not declared their colors, which means there is still potential for a consensus on color 1.

I should consider purchasing edges to agents who have a short path distance of 1, particularly focusing on those who have not declared a color yet.

I should prioritize purchasing edges to these players. I'll consider purchasing an edge to player 5 first, as this may yield better visibility for influencing the consensus.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current connections and the colors of those connections to make decisions that will maximize my payoff. I can see that there are players with both colors 0 and 1 in my connections. Since my projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0


I should focus on strengthening the consensus for color 1. However, there are several undeclared players connected to me, and I can purchase edges to see their colors, which may help in achieving a consensus. 
I will start by purchasing an edge to one of the undeclared players.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current connections and the colors of other agents to determine the best move. My current projected payoff for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0 (2.91 vs. 1.91), and I already have some connections with color 1. I want to maximize my payoff, so I should aim for a consensus on color 1. However


I have many undecided connections (color "None"). It may be beneficial to purchase edges to those players who can still be influenced to choose color 1.
