I need to buy edges to gather more information. Given that player 14 is connected to the one I see, it would be valuable to purchase an edge to them.

I need to connect with other players to gather more information about their colors. Given the projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0


I may take a conservative approach and connect with players who can potentially lean towards color 1. 
Looking through the degree and shortest path distances


I can purchase edges to other nodes, particularly those with a proximity to other players. The players with undetermined colors in this scenario may help me understand the network dynamics better. 
Considering this


I will start by purchasing an edge to player 1 as they have a reasonable degree and are within reachable distance.

I see that my connections (14, 1, and 0) all have an undeclared color, which means I don't have any definitive information about their color choices yet.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate the situation regarding my current color and the colors of my connections. Given that I have some connections already set to color 1, it seems beneficial to maintain that color for a potential consensus. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0


I should consider whether to purchase additional edges to connect with players who might also choose color 1. However


I currently have colors set to "None" from players 14, 0, 6, 7, and 11, which means they haven't declared yet. I should buy edges to players who are not currently my neighbors to increase my chance of influencing those who may choose color 1. 
Action: purchase_edge(8) 
(Note: I choose player 8 as they are a part of my shortest path but not currently in my colors dictionary. I will observe the new connections at the next turn.)

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate the current state of the network. I see that I have some connections with varying colors and some that are still undeclared. Since my projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than that for color 0


I should consider encouraging players to choose color 1. It might be beneficial to purchase an edge to a player who has not yet declared their color, particularly someone with a high degree of connection to increase the chances of consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to assess the colors of the players I am currently connected to. I see that some are still undeclared, and I already have a higher projected reward for a consensus of color 1. It would be strategic to purchase a connection to another player who hasn't declared their color yet. Player 9, 10, and 15 are potential targets since they are under my shortest path and haven’t been declared yet. I will purchase an edge to player 15, as it would allow for a chance to influence color choice before the game expires.
