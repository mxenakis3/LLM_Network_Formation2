I have no information on the colors of my current connections, so it may be wise to purchase edges to gain more information. Given that there are still many players I could connect to


I should consider purchasing edges to those players with the lowest shortest path distances or high degree to maximize my potential connections.

Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase new edges to better understand the colors of my connections in order to help form a consensus. Based on my current connections


I see that there are multiple players with undefined colors. I have a good chance of forming a consensus on color 0 since I already see one player (player 4) has committed to color 0. However


I also see that two players are committed to color 1. The projected reward for a consensus on color 0 is higher than on color 1. It might benefit me to purchase edges to players who are undeclared to try and influence the outcome towards color 0. 
I will start by purchasing an edge to one of the undeclared players to gain more information.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have some connections with players who have declared their colors, but many are still undeclared. I need to assess whether it's worth purchasing edges to connect with undeclared players to increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus on color 0, which provides a higher payoff. My current projected reward for color 0 is higher than for color 1, so I need to strategize accordingly.
For now


I might want to purchase an edge to one of the undeclared players to prompt more color visibility in future turns. This could help me decide whether to commit to color 0 or 1 later based on the consensus of my connections.
