Thought: I currently have no connections in the network, and therefore cannot see any colors. I need to buy edges to connect with other players so I can gather information about their colors in order to decide on my color strategy. Since I have a limited time remaining in the game


I will start by purchasing an edge to player 21, who is the next available player I can connect to.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see that I have an undeclared color and my only connection is to player 21, who has not declared their color either. Given that consensus on color 0 yields a better reward compared to color 1


I want to take action to maximize my chances of achieving consensus. Since I have no other connections


I should consider purchasing edges to other players to gather more information or influence their selections. Players 21 and 22 are the only ones I can connect to. Connecting to player 22 could be beneficial as they are just one step away and could sway the network towards a consensus on color 0.
