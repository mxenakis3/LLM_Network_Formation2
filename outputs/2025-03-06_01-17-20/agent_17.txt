**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections or visibility into the colors of other agents, and all agents have a degree of 0, meaning there are no existing edges to connect with. I need to purchase an edge to another player to gain visibility on their colors and potentially influence the consensus. Given that my projected rewards for consensus are better for color 1 (3)


I should explore connecting to a player to see if I can lead towards that color once I have visibility. I'll start by purchasing an edge to player 18.
