**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections in the network and my color is undeclared. Since all players are currently unconnected


I need to establish connections to other players to influence the game's outcome. My best strategy is to purchase edges to other players, as this will allow me to see their colors and decide how to set my color based on their decisions. Since all connection costs are the same (0.03)


I will aim to connect to players with potentially higher degrees or shorter paths next. 
Action: purchase_edge(19)  # I will attempt to connect to another player. However


I'll need to choose an ID for the purchase. I have to choose the next available neighbor_id, and since I don’t have the information about who to connect with


I'll assume selecting an ID higher than 19, starting with player 20.
(Note: Since only player 19 was specified, and there are no specific nodes to connect with given the inf values in the distance data


I'll go with a hypothetically chosen node for the purpose of demonstration.)

I should purchase connections to players with higher degrees. The highest degree identified is player 0 with a degree of 6. I will purchase an edge to player 0, as this will allow me to see their color in the next turn and assess the network better.
