**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections in the network as the colors dictionary is empty, and there is a maximum reward to be gained if I find a way to connect and assess the colors of other agents. I should start by purchasing an edge to reach at least one neighboring player to see their color, which will help me decide my next move. Since I can see agents based on their shortest path distance


I can purchase an edge to agent 32, who is a viable connection.
