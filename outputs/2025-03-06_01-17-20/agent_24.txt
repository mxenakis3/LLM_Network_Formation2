Thought: I see that my color is currently undeclared, and I only have one connection to agent 25, who has not declared their color yet. Given the projected reward for a consensus of color 0 is higher (2.97) than for color 1 (1.97)


I need to defend the chance of reaching that consensus. However


I currently have no way of knowing the stance of other agents since my shortest paths show "inf" for most players. I should consider purchasing edges to connect with more players to gather more information and potentially reach a consensus. I will buy an edge to agent 0, which has the highest degree of 8 and could provide valuable connections.

I should assess the potential for forming a consensus. My current connections (players 0 and 25) are still undeclared, so I have the option to buy edges to strengthen my position.
