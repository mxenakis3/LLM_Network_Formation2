**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players in the network, which means I cannot see any colors or make informed decisions yet. To participate and potentially optimize my payoff


I need to purchase edges to connect with other players. Since all players have a degree of 0 and I’m not connected to anyone


I should start by purchasing an edge to another player. I will choose to purchase an edge to player 5, as it is the next available neighbor.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish connections to other players in order to access information about their colors. Right now


I can only see that player 5 has an undeclared color. Since I could potentially gain more information


I should purchase an edge to another player. However


I need to consider which player to connect to for the best chance of consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1, as they are currently not connected to me and have a degree of 0, but a shortest path distance of infinity does not prevent me from considering them.
