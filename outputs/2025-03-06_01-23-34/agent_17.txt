**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, and the only player I can connect to is agent 17, who is myself. All other nodes have infinite shortest path distances, meaning there are no potential connections available to me in the network. Since I need to establish a connection to influence the color consensus, my options are limited. However


I must decide how to proceed with my actions. I should consider setting my color to maximize projected payoffs since I cannot purchase any connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I only have one connection (node 16) and their color is undeclared. Since I am currently set to color 1, and the maximum payoff for consensus of 1 is higher than for 0


I want to keep my color. However, to increase the chances of achieving consensus


I need to connect with more players to gain more information about their colors. I will purchase an edge to node 16, as they are the only player I can currently connect with.

I want to keep it that way for the higher potential payoff if consensus is reached for color 1. However, with no other connections, my chances of achieving consensus are low. Since I cannot connect to anyone else at this moment and the game time has expired


I will simply finish my turn.

I have the potential for a higher payoff if consensus for color 1 is reached. However

I want to stay with that color. However


I have the option to purchase edges to connect with other players that could help in reaching consensus. The game has expired, so I won't make any moves now since I cannot take any action. Finishing the loop is my only option, even though it seems I cannot act due to time restrictions.
