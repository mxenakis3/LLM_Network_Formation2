**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to assess the current game situation and decide whether to purchase an edge to another player or set my color. My current network only shows connection to player 0, who hasn't declared their color yet. My best payoffs come from a consensus on color 0, but I need more connections to evaluate the chances of achieving that consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(8)  # I choose to buy an edge to player 8, who is at shortest path distance 2 and may provide more information on their color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish a clearer strategy for earning the highest payoff. Currently


I have two connections (0 and 8) that are both undeclared. Since consensus on color 0 provides a better payoff than color 1


I should aim to understand the colors of my connections. To do this


I need to purchase an edge to another player to potentially gain more information, as the current connections might not lead to a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase a connection to player 1.
