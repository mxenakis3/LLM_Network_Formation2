**Agent**: 
Thought: I don't have any existing connections and thus cannot see any colors. I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player in order to see their color. This will help inform my decision on which color to set for myself. Since I have no connections


I will first purchase an edge to any available neighbor, which I will select as player 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I am connected to player 0, who has not yet declared a color. Since my current projected rewards for consensus of 1 (2.97) is higher than that for consensus of 0 (1.97)


I should try to reach consensus on color 1. To do this


I need to gather more information by purchasing edges to potentially discover other players' colors who might also lean towards color 1. Since I have connection options with several players who are not currently in my colors dictionary


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of those players. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1.
