Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and therefore cannot see any colors. In order to form a consensus


I should purchase an edge to another player, since the game objective is to achieve a consensus. I'm currently evaluating my options for purchasing an edge to maximize my potential payoff. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1, as they are the first available node.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have several connections with other agents, but their colors are all undeclared. Since I want to maximize my payoff


I should try to form connections with agents who are likely to lean towards color 0. My immediate neighbors all have undeclared colors, so I could purchase connections to new agents to see if any of them have declared their colors. Among the agents I can potentially connect to


I can see that Agent 4 is my highest degree option and not yet connected. I should purchase an edge to them in hopes of seeing their color next turn and maybe convince others to go for consensus on color 0.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to increase my chance of achieving a consensus on color 0 to maximize my projected payoff. Since I see that many of my connections have not yet declared their color


I should purchase more edges to connect to other players. This will help me gather more information about their color choices and potentially encourage others to choose color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2 first, as it's one of the players not currently connected, and their color is unknown.
