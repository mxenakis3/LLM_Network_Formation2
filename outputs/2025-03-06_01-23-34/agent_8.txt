**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, which means I cannot see anyone's color. To increase my chances of achieving a consensus


I should buy edges to connect to other players. Since all players have a degree of 0 and I have no declared colors


I need to purchase an edge to another player. I will choose to buy an edge to player 0, as they are the first player listed and I need to initiate a connection.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I have only one connection (agent 0), whose color is currently undeclared. Given that the projected payoff is higher for a consensus of color 0


I should aim for that. However


I should also consider purchasing edges to other agents to gather more information and potentially influence the network toward color 0. The nearest agents who are not connected to me could have an impact on my decision. 
Action: purchase_edge(4) 
(Note: I choose to purchase an edge to agent 4 as it's among those with the smallest degree and I hope to gather more information about their color which might help in forming a consensus.)
