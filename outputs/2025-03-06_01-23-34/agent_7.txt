Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no existing connections in the network, which means that I cannot see any colors of other agents. Since I need to earn points by achieving a consensus on a color


I should consider purchasing edges to connect with other players. As they all have a degree of 0 and no colors declared


I need to buy edges to establish connections and gather information about their colors. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to one of the players, starting with player 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have a connection to agent 0, who has not yet declared their color. My projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than that for 0, which means I might want to work towards that consensus. However


I should also consider purchasing edges to other players to gain more information about their color choices. Given my degree indicates I can connect to other players


I should look to buy edges to players with shorter path distances who might also be influential in reaching a consensus for color 1. The next best players based on my shortest path distances are 1 (2), 3 (2), 4 (2), 5 (2), 6 (2), 8 (2), 9 (2), 11 (2), 13 (2), 14 (2), 15 (2). 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # Buying a connection to agent 1 for further information on color decisions.
