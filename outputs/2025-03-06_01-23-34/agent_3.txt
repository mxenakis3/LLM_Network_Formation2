Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other agents in the network, as indicated by the empty colors dictionary. I need to make a purchase to connect with another player to increase my chances of reaching a consensus on a color. Given that all agents have no degree connections


I will begin by purchasing an edge to one of the players. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will connect to player 0 as they are the first in the dictionary and I need to start somewhere.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish connections with other players to see their colors and increase the chances of reaching a consensus. I already have connections to players 2 and 0, both of whom are undeclared. I should consider purchasing edges to other players to gather more information. Since my projected reward for consensus of 1 is currently higher


I should also keep that in mind while deciding which neighbors to connect to.
