Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, and since I have to establish connections in order to influence the color choices


I need to purchase an edge to someone in the network. There are no connections visible to me. Given that all players have zero connections and I am unable to see their colors, the best action would be to purchase an edge to one of the other players in the network. 
Action: purchase_edge(neighbor_id=0)  # I will attempt to purchase an edge to player 0 since all players are currently isolated.


**System**: 
Format the parameter as the integer representing the agent id of the agent you would like to connect with, ex: (1) for agent 1. :

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and need to purchase an edge to connect with another player. Since I want to maximize my potential payoff


I should try to find a player who will either help me reach consensus on color 0 or has the potential to connect further. Players with the highest degree are more likely to have connections leading to other players. The player with the highest degree is 0, with 12 connections. I will purchase an edge to player 0.
