Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections and cannot see the colors of any other players. To potentially increase my payoff


I should purchase an edge to connect with another player in the network. I should strategically choose a neighbor to connect to since I can only see the colors of those players I am directly connected with. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will attempt to connect to player 0 as the first step.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that there are two players I can connect to: player 4 and player 0. Currently, both of them have not declared their colors, and if we can reach a consensus


I have a better projected reward for color 1. Since player 0 is also directly connected to player 4, they could influence each other. Therefore


I should purchase an edge to either player 0 or player 4 to gain more information, but since player 4 is already in my connections


I will target player 0 to expand my network.
