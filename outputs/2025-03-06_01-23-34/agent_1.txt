**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, and my color is undeclared. To increase my chances of forming a consensus


I need to purchase edges to other players since I have no information about their colors. The best option is to purchase edges to the players with the lowest IDs initially, as they are my only option. I will prioritize building connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate the potential outcomes based on the current state of the game. I can see that my only connection is to agent 0, whose color is undecided. Since I have a higher projected payoff for consensus on color 1


I should consider purchasing connections to other players to potentially gather more information about their colors and influence consensus. 
I will check the degree and shortest path dictionaries to identify any players I can connect with that are not currently in my colors dictionary. The best candidates seem to be agents with low shortest path distances to me and degree greater than zero, such as agent 5 (distance 2) or agent 6 (distance 2). 
Since I cannot declare a color yet (I'm still undecided)


I should buy an edge to one of these agents to explore more options and possibly align with a group.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to gather more information by purchasing edges to better understand my competitors' color choices and maximize my projected payoff. Since my current neighbors have not yet declared their colors, it is prudent to buy edges to players I am not connected with, especially those with a significant degree, to facilitate quicker consensus. Given that I can buy an edge for 0.03


I still maintain a better projected reward for selecting color 1. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I choose to connect to node 2, as it has the shortest path of 3 and could be crucial for potential consensus.
