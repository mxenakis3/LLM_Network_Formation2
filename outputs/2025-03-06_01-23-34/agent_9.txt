Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and cannot see any colors from other players. To increase my chances of reaching a consensus and maximizing my payoff


I should purchase an edge to connect with other players. Since I am agent 9 and can purchase edges


I will strategically choose to connect with other agents who may help establish a consensus. Given that I have no information about them


I will start by purchasing an edge to agent 0.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I currently have one connection (node 0) and its color is undeclared. My projected rewards for agreeing on a color are higher for color 1 (2.97). Since node 0 has not committed to any color yet


I cannot determine its choice. However


I should consider purchasing edges to increase my visibility of other players' colors, especially since a consensus on color 1 gives me a higher reward. My immediate action should be to purchase edges to other players who are close to me to gather more information.
