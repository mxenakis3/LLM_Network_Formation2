Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and the colors dictionary is empty


I need to purchase an edge to create a connection with another player in order to participate in the game. My goal is to establish a link and see the colors of at least one other player, which will help determine whether to pursue color 0 or color 1 for a consensus. I have multiple options to connect with, so I should buy an edge to player 0, as they might help form a consensus.
