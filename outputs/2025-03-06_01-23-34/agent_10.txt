Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I do not have any connections since the colors dictionary is empty, and with no information on other players' colors


I will need to purchase an edge to a neighboring player to increase my chances of forming a consensus. Since all my available edges have no existing connections


I will need to buy an edge to connect with another player and see their color. I need to choose a neighbor to purchase the edge. Given my position


I will purchase an edge to player 11.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to build connections in order to gain more information about the colors of the network. Since I currently only have one connection (to agent 11) and their color is undeclared


I should consider purchasing edges to other agents to increase my chances of reaching a color consensus. Agents 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are potential connections I can afford. Given that I can gain more insight by connecting to those agents


I should purchase an edge to one of them.
