**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, and all players are currently undeclared, which means I cannot see anyone's color. Since I need to maximize my reward


I should purchase edges to connect with other players. Given that there are no other connections to see


I will start by purchasing an edge to player 0, who I can connect with.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase an edge to another player or set my color. I see that my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0, and I do not have any declared colors from my current connections. It would be beneficial to connect with other players and gain more information about their colors.
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 5, as they have 2 connections and may be more likely to have a declared color.
