Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, which means I cannot see any colors. However


I need to make a move to connect with other players in order to potentially reach a consensus. Since my projected payoff for a consensus of color 0 is higher than for color 1


I want to aim for color 0. I will purchase edges to connect with other players in the network. 
Action: purchase_edge(3)  # I will start by connecting to player 3 as it’s the first available player.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish more connections to better understand the color choices of other players in the network. Currently


I only have a connection to player 3 who has not declared their color yet. Making connections to other players might help me gauge if a consensus can be reached for color 0, which offers a higher payoff. Given that I need more information


I will purchase an edge to another player. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # Choosing player 1 with a known distance.
