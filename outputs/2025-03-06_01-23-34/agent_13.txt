Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and cannot see the colors of any other players. I need to start by purchasing edges to connect with other players, ideally ones who may help reach a consensus. Given that there’s no information on the available players


I'll prioritize purchasing an edge to player 13, since it’s the lowest ID and I could potentially have a better chance connecting with someone.

You have attempted to purchase an edge to yourself. As a reminder, you are agent 13. You can already read your color information, it is Undeclared:

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connections at the moment, so I need to purchase edges to other players to start gaining information about their colors. The player with the highest degree is player 0 with a degree of 4; connecting with them could be beneficial for consensus building. Therefore


I will purchase an edge to player 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase an edge or set my color based on the current connections and the projected rewards. I see that I have one connection (to player 0) with an undeclared color and that there are more players I can connect with to potentially influence the consensus. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher, it might be beneficial to connect with other players who could also be inclined towards color 1. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will try to purchase an edge to player 1 to see their color next turn.
