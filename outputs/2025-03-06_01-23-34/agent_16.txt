**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no current connections in the network, and both the degrees and shortest path distances indicate that I cannot reach any other players. In this situation


I should first establish a connection to another player to potentially influence the consensus. Since all players currently have a degree of 0


I need to choose a player to purchase an edge to. I will start by purchasing an edge to player 17, as they are the only available option.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I currently have only one connection to player 17, who has chosen color 1. Since I don’t have any connections to other players


I need to decide whether to purchase an edge to another player to gather more information or set my color to 0 or 1. Given that my projected reward for consensus on color 0 is higher at 2.97, it may be worthwhile to reach out to potential players to gather information first. I should look for players with low distance that I can connect to.
