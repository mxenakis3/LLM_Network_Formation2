My current connections (11 and 0) have undeclared colors, but I can purchase connections to other nodes in the network.

I should consider purchasing edges to nodes that may have a higher likelihood of supporting color 0. The nodes with undeclared colors could be distributed in a way that favors color 0, but I need to expand my connections to decrease the unknowns and increase potential consensus.

I need to either convince some of my connections to go with color 0 or purchase edges to players who may also lean towards color 0. I currently stand to gain more from a consensus of color 0, but need to act quickly. 
Since two of my neighbors (11 and 0) are undeclared while the rest are also undeclared


I could try to purchase an edge to potentially influential nodes. Players with a higher degree may be more likely to influence consensus, so I will look to purchase edges to players that are well-connected and are not already among my current connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to determine the best strategy to maximize my payoff. The current consensus for color 0 gives a higher projected reward than for color 1. I need to decide whether to buy edges to players who are not connected to me, especially to those who might help me form a larger consensus for color 0. I see that several of my connections are undeclared, and my own color is undeclared, so buying edges to players who might lean towards color 0 could be beneficial.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current connections and potentially purchase edges to maximize my payoff by reaching a consensus on the color. Since I currently have a moderate projected reward for a consensus of 0 and a lower reward for a consensus of 1


I should lean towards encouraging the color 0. To do this


I should examine my connections carefully and consider purchasing edges to those who have not yet declared a color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have a higher projected reward if the entire network chooses color 0, but many of my connections are either undeclared or have committed to color 1. I need to analyze my existing connections and the potential benefits of purchasing new edges to other players who may help me achieve a consensus for color 0. Since I have only a couple of connections that are undeclared


I should consider purchasing edges to players who have not declared yet or contribute positively to achieving consensus for color 0. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 1, which based on the degree and shortest path information is a valid target, and their color is currently undeclared. 
(Note: The action assumes I will start with player 1 since they are one of the nearest undeclared options.)

I need to act quickly. Since I have several connections that are undeclared
