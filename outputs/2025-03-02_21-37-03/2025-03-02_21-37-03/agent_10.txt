I should analyze which ones to buy for optimal connectivity.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that many of my connections have declared their color as 1, while others are undeclared. If I set my color to 1, it seems more likely that we may reach a consensus, but my potential payoff is lower than if I manage to push for a consensus of 0. However, since several agents are already committed to 1


I should consider purchasing edges to players who are undeclared to gather more information and potentially shift the consensus towards color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(6)
(Note: I've chosen to purchase an edge to player 6 because they are one of the nodes I am not yet connected to and may help me ascertain more about the network.)

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I notice that a lot of my connections are currently undeclared, and there is already a consensus of color 1 among some of my connections. However, if I can establish more connections and possibly influence the network to lean towards color 0


I could increase my projected payoff. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 0 is greater than that for a consensus of 1


I need to encourage more players to pick color 0. I will start by purchasing an edge to connect with a player that is currently undeclared and close in distance to increase my network.
