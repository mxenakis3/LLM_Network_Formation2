I might increase my chances of a higher payoff. I need to analyze the risk of purchasing edges versus committing to a color now.

Thought: I have numerous players who have opted for color '1', and since I currently have an undeclared color


I need to decide whether to set my color to '0' or '1'. If I set my color to '0', there is a risk of not reaching a consensus since a significant number of players already hold '1'. Setting my color to '1' may align me with some players, but I need to weigh the value of purchasing new edges to connect with undeclared players. Currently, my projected reward for a consensus of '0' is higher, but the risk is substantial. It may be wiser to buy connections to those who are undeclared to gather more information first before deciding on my color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to analyze the current colors of my connections to determine whether I should purchase edges to connect with more players or set my color. Currently


I see that most of my connected players (3, 7, 1, 15, 9, 11, 13) have chosen color 1. My projected rewards indicate a consensus is leaning towards 0, but my connections seem to favor 1. I need to assess if purchasing edges to others can help sway the consensus or if I should declare my color based on what I see. Given that I have several undeclared players among my neighbors, it might be prudent to buy edges to connect with them, especially since I might need those players to make a stronger case for a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to connect with player 2 who is currently undeclared.
