I need to purchase connections to other players. However, since all players have a degree of 0


I cannot connect to anyone at the moment. It seems that I need to wait to see how the game unfolds or perhaps wait for other players to make their moves first.

Thought: I currently have no connections in the network and cannot see any colors of other players. However


I can see from the degree dictionary that there are players available for me to connect with. Since I need to build connections to enhance my understanding of the game's colors


I should purchase edges to players who might have a declared color. Given that my own color is undeclared


I should be cautious about whom to connect with first. Player 2 has a degree of 1, which suggests they are connected to one other player, making them a reasonable candidate for an edge purchase.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to player 10 to see their color declaration. This could help me determine if I should aim for consensus on color 1, given that several of my connections have already declared as 1. I will assess whether spending on this edge is worthwhile based on my current rewards.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges or set my color based on the current projections and the colors of my connections. Since my projected payoff for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0


I should consider trying to align with players who are already leaning towards color 1. There are several players with a known color of 1. I will purchase edges to players who are undeclared to increase my chance of reaching a consensus on color 1.
