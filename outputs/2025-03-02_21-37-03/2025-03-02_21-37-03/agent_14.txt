I may align with them and avoid losing out completely. However


I could also purchase edges to other players to potentially sway the vote towards color 0, which has a higher maximum projected payoff if achieved. My current projected rewards are low for both colors, especially for color 1. I should consider purchasing connections to players who are not declared yet, so I can gather more information on their color choices and potentially influence the game's outcome.
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I'll purchase an edge to player 2, as they have no declared color and are within my reachable network.
