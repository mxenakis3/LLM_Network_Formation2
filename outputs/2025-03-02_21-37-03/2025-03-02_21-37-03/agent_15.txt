Thought: I currently have no connections and can’t see any colors, so I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player. This will allow me to see their color on the next turn. Since I want to optimize my chance of winning


I can assume that having multiple players lean towards a consensus will help, and I have a higher payoff if I can get a consensus for color 1. I'll choose to purchase an edge to another agent, starting with the lowest ID available (agent 0).

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players or to set my color to maximize my payoff. Given that my projected payoff for a consensus of 1 is higher than that for consensus of 0


I should consider maintaining my color as 1. However


I also notice that there are players who have not declared their colors. There are potential players to connect with, so I can also increase my influence in the network. I should purchase edges to players whose colors are undeclared to see if they align with color 1.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # Purchasing edge to player 0, who is undeclared.
