Thought: I currently have no connections to other players in the network, and all players are also undeclared. I need to purchase edges to connect with other players if I want to influence the network towards a consensus. Since no one has declared a color


I should prioritize purchasing connections to explore potential alliances. My projected payoff for declaring a color is higher for consensus 1, so I might want to lean towards that. However


I first need to establish connections.

I should consider purchasing edges to other agents to see their colors and gauge the probability of reaching a consensus.

I need to choose wisely. I will purchase an edge to agent 3, as they have a degree of 2, suggesting they may influence the decision.

I have three connections (0, 2, and 3), all of which are undeclared. Since my projected payoff for a consensus color of 1 is greater than that for 0


I should aim for that. However, at least one of my connections needs to be declared. I can either wait for the next turn to see what my connections decide or purchase an edge to another player to potentially increase my network influence.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that my color is currently set to 1 and the colors of the players I am connected to show that there are some already committed to color 1. My projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is greater than for color 0, so it seems beneficial to encourage others to commit to color 1. However, there are some players who are undeclared. I need to maximize my connections to potentially sway them. I will purchase an edge to one of the undeclared players who has a high degree to increase my chances of getting a consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current situation in the game to decide whether to purchase additional edges or stay with my current color. My current projected reward for consensus 1 is higher than for consensus 0, and I already have colors seen that lean towards color 1. I can try to strengthen this consensus by purchasing edges to players with "undeclared" colors to potentially influence them towards color 1.
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # Buying an edge to player 2, who has an undeclared color.
