I must first purchase an edge to a neighbor so that I can start gathering information on their colors and potentially influence the consensus. The only available neighbor is player 9, as the distances to all other players are infinite. I'll proceed to purchase an edge to player 9.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I want to maximize my payoff, and I already see that the projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0. I have some connections that have set their color to 1, which makes me lean towards maintaining my color as 1. However


I also have several connections that have not declared a color, and I might need to purchase more edges to increase my chances of reaching a consensus of 1. My next step should be to purchase an edge to one of the undeclared neighbors.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current situation and make a decision on whether to purchase edges to improve my chances of reaching consensus on my color or to stay with my current color and hope for a consensus. Since my projected reward for consensus on color 1 is higher


I should focus on that. I see that there are several neighbors with undeclared colors, which means I might be able to influence them. Buying edges to these players could potentially help me form a consensus on color 1.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to player 0, who is a high-degree player with the potential to impact the game.
