**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate whether to purchase edges to other players or set my color. Given the color information of my current connections, the majority of them are leaning towards color 1. To maximize my payoff


I should consider whether there's a way to still reach consensus for color 0 with additional connections, or if I should set my color to 1 to align with the majority. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 2, who is currently undeclared, as they have a high degree and may sway the consensus. 
(Note: Assuming I have the option to purchase player 2 based on the edges available.)

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase new edges or set my color based on the current colors of my connections. There are several players with "undeclared" colors. Since many of my connections have declared color 1, my projected payoff for a consensus of 1 is higher than for color 0. However, there are still undeclared players that could affect this. Given that my projected reward is higher for color 0


I may consider purchasing edges to gather more information before making a final decision on my color.
