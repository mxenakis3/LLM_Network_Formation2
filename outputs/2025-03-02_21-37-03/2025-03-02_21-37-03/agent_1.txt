Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, which means I cannot see anyone's colors. Since I am not connected to anyone


I need to purchase edges to establish connections. My goal is to determine whether the other agents are leaning towards color 0 or 1. Given that both the projected rewards for consensus is favorable


I will purchase an edge to the lowest ID player that I can connect to, which in this case is player 2.

I can achieve a higher projected payoff if more players choose color 1. I need to ponder whether to wait for more connections or declare my color now. However, there's a higher projected payoff for color 1, and since I only have one connection

I may also consider purchasing an edge to a player with a shorter path. I should prioritize players that are closer to me and have not declared their colors.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see the colors of some of my connections, and it appears that there is a strong leaning towards color 1 among my connected agents. My projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0. Since I already have a color of 1 and most of my connections also have color 1, it seems wise to reinforce that by not purchasing any new edges at this moment. My next best move is to finish my turn and hope for the consensus on color 1, maximizing my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that my projected reward for consensus on color 1 is significantly higher than for color 0. Moreover


I already have several connections that have chosen color 1, and some connections are currently undeclared. Since my current color is already set to 1 and I have connections leaning towards color 1


I need to secure more connections to bolster this consensus. I should buy edges to the players with undeclared colors to increase the likelihood of them also choosing color 1.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since the time is up and I can’t take any further actions


I need to evaluate my situation. I have already committed to color 1, which has a higher potential reward for consensus. I have several connections that also support color 1. If the consensus reaches color 1


I will secure a payoff of approximately 2.91. Overall


I believe my best position is established.

**Agent**: 
Thought: It seems the game time has expired again, and I can no longer make any moves. I have already selected color 1, which has the potential for a higher reward due to the consensus with other players. This means I require the network to reach consensus on color 1 to secure the payoff. Although I cannot act further


I believe I have positioned myself favorably to achieve the highest potential reward if consensus is achieved.
