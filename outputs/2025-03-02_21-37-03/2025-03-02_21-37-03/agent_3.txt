I don't have enough information to set my color confidently. Since I can see player 0's color


I can either wait for them to declare or purchase an edge to another player for more information. However, all other players are currently unreachable (inf distance), and player 0 might be key in forming a consensus. I should consider purchasing the connection first to gather more information.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have connections to players 0, 2, and 17, all of whom have undeclared colors. My best chance for a consensus appears to be with color 1, given the higher projected payoff associated with that consensus. Since I still lack clear information about their chosen colors


I can either wait for someone to declare their color or purchase additional edges to other players. However, many players remain unreachable, and the current options provide limited insight. I should purchase an edge to see if I can connect with a player who might have declared their color, helping me to make a more informed choice. 
Since all my current connections have undeclared colors and the consensus for color 1 has a higher projected payout, it's more advantageous for immediate action. I need to purchase an edge to either player 1 or player 4, who are both reachable.

Thought: I see that I have more connections now, and two players (0 and 1) have declared color 1. My projected reward for color 1 (2.97) is higher than that for color 0 (1.97), which strengthens the case for me to lean towards color 1. I still have several connections with undeclared colors.

Thought: I will purchase an edge to a player who is currently undeclared, in order to potentially influence more players to choose color 1. Since I have already identified that player 4 is undeclared, it would be a strategic move to connect with them.
