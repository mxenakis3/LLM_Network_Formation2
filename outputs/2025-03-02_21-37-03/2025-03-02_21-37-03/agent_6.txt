I will start by purchasing an edge to agent 0, as they have no connections either.

Thought: I observe that I have only one connection, which is to player 0, and their color is currently undeclared. My projected reward for consensus on color 0 is higher than for color 1. However, since I cannot see other players' colors


I may need to purchase edges to gain better information about the network. I should consider purchasing connections to players that are not my current connections in order to gather more information and potentially influence the consensus towards color 0.
I can see that I have paths to players 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

I need to consider buying edges to neighboring players who are not yet connected to me. 
Given that I have a degree of 2


I can afford to purchase connections. The players that have short path distances of 2 (and are not already in my connections) are 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17.

**Agent**: 
Thought: My current color is set to 0, but there is more potential to achieve a higher payoff by encouraging consensus towards color 0. The majority of my connections are leaning towards color 1, which reduces my projected payoff for consensus 0. I can buy edges to players with undecided colors to increase my chances of shifting them towards color 0 or finding allies that may help reach consensus. I should analyze which players I can purchase connections to that may sway the outcome.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see that many of my connections have chosen color 1, while several others are still undeclared. Since I currently have a projected reward of 2.79 for consensus on color 0 and 1.79 for consensus on color 1


I need to decide whether to purchase more edges or set my color. Given that my connections mostly lean towards color 1, it might be wise to attempt to purchase edges to players who might still declare color 0, thus supporting a potential consensus. I should look for profitable edges to players that are currently undeclared. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2, as their color is undeclared and could help me achieve a consensus on color 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Currently


I have a projected reward of 2.79 for consensus on color 0, which is higher than the 1.79 reward for color 1. Given that many of my connections are leaning towards color 1


I should consider either purchasing edges to increase the likelihood of reaching color 0 or setting my color to 1, but that would reduce my payoff unless more players lean towards color 0. Since the time is up and it seems there are no profitable actions left to take effectively


I should finalize my turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have not made any recent changes to my strategy, and I still have a higher projected payoff for consensus on color 0 (2.79) than for color 1 (1.79). With the countdown showing negative time, it seems that the game is about to end. To maximize my potential reward


I should consider sealing my current choice by finishing my turn. I can't purchase any new edges or set a new color as there are no new beneficial actions to take at this point.
