I need to consider the potential payoff for consensus. The current payoff for choosing color 1 is higher (2.97) than for color 0 (1.97). Therefore


I should focus on establishing more connections to understand the overall consensus in color. I'll purchase an edge to player 3, who is within my range and could provide valuable information about the network.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide what color to choose in order to maximize my projected reward. Currently, the projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher than for color 0. However, my connections are undeclared, and I have only connected to agents whose colors I cannot see yet. I could consider purchasing edges to other nodes with either higher degrees or shorter path distances to gather more information about the game state and potentially reach a consensus. 
Action: I will purchase an edge to player 2 since they have two connections and a shorter path distance of 2. This will give me more information about their color, and they are not currently in my colors dictionary. 
(Note: If I cannot see any colors on the next turn and need to establish a stronger network


I may consider further purchases or weighing options based on new information.)

Thought: I still need to gather more information about the colors of my connections since they are currently undeclared. I see that I can purchase an edge to player 1, who has a degree of 5 and a shortest path distance of 2, which may increase my chances of forming a consensus if they declare their color. Additionally, the projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is significantly higher. Therefore


I should pursue connections that help me establish my color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that my projected reward for consensus on color 1 is higher than for color 0, and I am currently set to color 1. However


I need to ensure that enough other players also select color 1 to reach a consensus. Most of my connections are either 'undeclared' or already committed to color 1, which is a good sign. I may want to purchase additional connections to gather more information or sway undecided players towards color 1. Since player 2 and player 4 are undeclared


I could consider purchasing edges to them.
