Thought: I currently have no connections to other players since my colors dictionary is empty. I need to establish connections to other players to be able to see their colors. Since I have the potential to earn a higher payoff if the entire network selects color 0


I should connect to other players. However


I need to choose the most connected or strategic players to maximize my chances of forming a consensus. Since everyone has a degree of 0


I can purchase connections to any other player. I will start by purchasing an edge to player 0 to observe their color next turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that most of my connections are declaring color 1, with several connections being undeclared. The projected reward for declaring color 0 is significantly higher than for color 1. However


I will need more connections to players to maximize my chances of consensus if I choose color 0. Since my current connections mainly favor color 1


I should consider purchasing edges to players who are undeclared to increase my potential for forming a consensus for color 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I must analyze the colors of my connections to determine if I should purchase edges or set my color. The majority of my connections (0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 5, 14, 10) are currently undeclared, while several are set to color 1. Since the projected reward for consensus of color 0 is higher, yet currently only a few players can support that


I need to assess whether connecting to other players is beneficial to influence the consensus towards color 0.

Thought: The game time has expired, and I need to make a decision based on the current situation. The majority of my connections have committed to color 1, and my projected reward for color 0 is higher but not achievable currently without consensus. Given there is no time left


I should either set my color or finish, but since setting my color may not influence the outcome now


I should simply end my turn.
