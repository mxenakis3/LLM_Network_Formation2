You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and cannot see any colors


I need to purchase an edge to another player to gain visibility on their color and move towards reaching a consensus. I should prioritize players who currently have no connections, as it may help establish a larger network and increase the likelihood of consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connections and my color is undeclared


I need to purchase an edge to a player to gather information about their color and ideally reach consensus. I will start by buying an edge to one of the players in the network to obtain their color information. This will help me make an informed decision on my color choice in order to maximize my payoff.

I should purchase an edge to one of the players to gather information about their color. I will prioritize purchasing an edge to one of the players with a color seen, as they may help me reach a consensus and maximize my payout. I have enough time to make a decision before the game ends.
