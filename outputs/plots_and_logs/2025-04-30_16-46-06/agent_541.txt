**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and therefore no information about their colors


I should purchase an edge to a neighboring player to gain insight into the potential consensus color and strategy for maximizing my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors


I need to purchase an edge to an agent to gather information about their colors and increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus before time runs out. I should prioritize an agent with other connections to maximize the potential for consensus.
