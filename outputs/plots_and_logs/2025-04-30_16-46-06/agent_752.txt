You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and cannot see any other colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players to potentially see their color and increase my chances of achieving consensus for a payout. I will prioritize purchasing an edge to a player who seems less connected to increase the likelihood of a distinct choice, thereby aiming to influence the consensus decision.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and cannot see any colors


I should choose color '1' immediately. It gives me a chance to achieve a consensus if other players also choose '1', which has a projected reward of 3. Waiting or taking action to connect to players who are unreachable within the time remaining will not be beneficial.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I should purchase an edge to player 541, as they are unconnected and have not declared a color. This will allow me to see their color and help determine if I should declare my color as 0 or 1 for consensus, especially given that it's the only opportunity to influence the game's outcome before time runs out.
