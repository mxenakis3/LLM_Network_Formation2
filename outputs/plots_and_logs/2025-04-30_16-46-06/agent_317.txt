**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and no visibility into their colors


I should purchase an edge to a player to gather information about their color. I will choose a player to connect to, as this action will allow me to see their color and make a more informed decision on whether to adopt color 0 or color 1 for potential consensus. Time is limited, so quick action is necessary.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no direct connections to any players, and my color is undeclared. To maximize my potential for reaching consensus


I will need to purchase an edge to another agent, as this will give me insight into their color and help me make a more informed decision. I should prioritize purchasing an edge to a player who is most likely to have a color that aligns with my goal of achieving consensus, preferably agent 629 since they have the least amount of connections and may not have chosen a color yet.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and my only connected neighbor (agent 629) has chosen color 0


I should also choose color 0 to align with my neighbor. This will help us reach consensus and ensure I receive a projected reward as we have a higher chance of achieving a payout by choosing the same color.
