You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no neighbors in the network and my current color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the agents to gather information about their color and decide my color based on that information to maximize my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I cannot see any connected colors and none of my neighbors is connected to me (meaning they are not voting yet)


I need to purchase an edge to gather more information. This will allow me to see the colors of at least one player, which is essential to make an informed decision before the time runs out. After the purchase


I can decide on a color based on what I see.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am undeclared and have no connected neighbors


I should immediately choose color '0' to maximize my projected reward, as it appears to offer a higher payoff compared to choosing color '1'. Additionally, there is no potential to achieve consensus with the other players, so I will take my chance with color '0' before time runs out.
