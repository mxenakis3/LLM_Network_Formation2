**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is currently undeclared


I should purchase an edge to a player (e.g., agent 629) in order to potentially connect with other players and be informed about their color choices, which is crucial for reaching a consensus before the time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only neighbor (agent 629) has not declared a color yet


I should purchase an edge to connect with another agent who is not currently in my colors dictionary. This may increase my chances of gathering information or influencing a consensus. However


I must be cautious as it will reduce my possible payoff. Therefore


I will look to purchase an edge, hoping to connect with a player who will eventually declare a color.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 629:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have a direct connection to player 629 who has chosen color "0," I should declare my color as "0" to align with my neighbor and increase the chances of achieving consensus. Declaring "0" will also allow me to potentially earn a higher payoff than if I declared "1."
