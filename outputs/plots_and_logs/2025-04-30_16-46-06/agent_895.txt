**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no neighbors in the network (all connections show a degree of 0 and no colors)


I should purchase an edge to a random player to gain a connection and see their color. This will allow me to make a more informed decision about my own color choice and increase the chances of reaching a consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Given that I have no connected neighbors and my current color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected players (preferably one with the lowest degree). This will allow me to potentially see their color and make a more informed decision on my own color to maximize my payout, particularly since I can either aim for consensus on color '0' or '1'.

**Agent**:

I should purchase an edge to a player who is not yet in my colors dictionary. This will allow me to potentially see their color and make a more informed decision about which color to choose before time expires.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and am currently undeclared


I should choose a color (either 0 or 1) based on projected rewards to maximize my payout. Since projecting a reward of 3 for color 0 is higher than 2 for color 1


I should declare my color as **0** to aim for the higher payoff.
