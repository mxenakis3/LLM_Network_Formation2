You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

Thought: I need to purchase edges to nearby players in order to connect with them and uncover their colors, as I currently have no connections and cannot reach consensus without knowing their choices. I should prioritize players who might help me achieve consensus effectively.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have one connected player (agent 566) whose color is also undeclared


I should change my color to '0' to attempt to influence 566 to adopt the same color, as the projected rewards for choosing '0' are higher (3) compared to '1' (2). This could help reach consensus and maximize my payoff as time is running out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and only connected to one player (566), who has not yet declared their color


I should purchase an edge to a different player in order to gain more information about their color and increase the chances of reaching consensus. Given the time remaining


I should act quickly to ensure I maximize my payoff potential. I will buy an edge to a neighboring player.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 566:
