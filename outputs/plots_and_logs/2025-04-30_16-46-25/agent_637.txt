You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and thus no knowledge of their colors


I need to purchase an edge to one of the unconnected players to gather information and increase my chances of reaching consensus. I should choose the player that gives me the best potential for identifying a majority color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no neighbors with visible colors


I should purchase an edge to a player, as it is crucial to connect with others to gather information about their colors and facilitate consensus. This will help me decide the best color to choose for maximizing my payout.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and no visible colors


I should declare my color as '1' to potentially align with the highest projected reward, given that other players may choose colors that lead to consensus and maximize my payoff.
