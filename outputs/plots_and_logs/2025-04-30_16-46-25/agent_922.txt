**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no neighbors in the network and no visibility into the colors of any other players


I should purchase an edge to one of the agents to gather information and increase the chances of reaching consensus. Given that time is running low


I need to act quickly. I will choose to connect with one of the agents who are not already in my colors dictionary.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no direct connections to other players (all appear to have a degree of 0)


I should purchase an edge to one of the players in order to gather information about their colors. This will help determine if I should declare color 0 or 1 to potentially reach consensus and maximize my payoff. I need to decide on a player to connect with before the time expires.
