**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and the time is running out


I should declare my color as '1' to aim for a higher potential payout of 3, given that the current state does not allow me to gather additional information or make connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and cannot see any colors


I need to purchase an edge to a nearby player, preferably one who might help in achieving consensus, to have a chance at securing a payout. I'll prioritize purchasing an edge to any of the unconnected agents.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no connected players with visible colors


I should purchase an edge to another player in order to potentially reveal their color and make a decision that increases my chances of reaching consensus.
