**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and no information about other players' colors


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the nearby agents to gather more information. I see that all agents have a degree of 0, which means they haven't made any connections either. I will purchase an edge to one of the players, like player 251, to see their color and determine my next action for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have one neighbor (agent 251) who has not chosen a color yet


I need to choose color '1' as my declaration. This choice maximizes my projected reward (2.97) while encouraging a potential consensus towards '1' if my neighbor also chooses that color. Waiting could also risk achieving no consensus, so I must act now before time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since both of my connected neighbors (251 and 414) have not declared a color


I have the opportunity to choose a color without knowing their decisions. To maximize my payoff and increase the chances of consensus


I should choose color '1' as it provides a higher potential payout (2.97) compared to color '0' (1.97).
