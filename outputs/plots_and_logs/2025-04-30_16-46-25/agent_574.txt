**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since there are no connected players and I have no information about their colors


I should purchase an edge to one player to gather information. This will allow me to see their color and potentially decide on a color based on the consensus of connected players.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 0 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am not connected to any players and have no information about their colors


I should consider purchasing an edge to another player to gather information. This will allow me to understand the color choices of other agents and help me decide on a color to ensure that we reach consensus before time expires. I will need to prioritize connecting to players who might have a higher probability of agreeing on a color.
