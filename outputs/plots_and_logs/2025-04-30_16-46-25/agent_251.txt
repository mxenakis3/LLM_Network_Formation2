You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and there is no information about their colors


I should purchase an edge to a player in order to at least gain visibility into another player's color and increase my chances of reaching consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and am currently undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the players in order to reveal their color and potentially formulate a strategy for reaching consensus before the time expires.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am connected to two players (503 and 414), both of whom have not declared their colors yet


I need to choose my color strategically to maximize my payoff. Given that the projected rewards suggest a consensus on color '0' yields more payout (3) than color '1' (2), and I should assume that my best chance for consensus would be to declare '0' myself. If the other players eventually declare color '0' as well


I would earn the maximum payoff.
