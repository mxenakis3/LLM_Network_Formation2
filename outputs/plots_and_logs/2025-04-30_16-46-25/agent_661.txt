**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and thus no information about their colors


I should purchase an edge to a player not already in my colors dictionary to gather intelligence. This will help me decide whether to choose color 0 or 1 based on what they select.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connections and cannot see any colors of other players. I should purchase an edge to one of the available players to gather information about their colors, as this will help me decide on a consensus color before time runs out. Since there are no connections


I will take a risk and buy an edge to a randomly selected player.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players with declared colors


I need to purchase an edge to another player to gather information about potential consensus colors. I should prioritize connecting to players with a degree greater than zero, as they likely have made their choices. I will choose one of these players to maximize my chances of reaching consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the players. This will allow me to potentially see their color and make a decision to either align with them or choose my color based on new information. Given the projected rewards


I would prefer to align with a player who might choose '1' to maximize my payoff. However


I cannot assume anything about their color until I make a connection. I should choose a player who has a higher degree (connections) to maximize my chances of finding a consensus.
