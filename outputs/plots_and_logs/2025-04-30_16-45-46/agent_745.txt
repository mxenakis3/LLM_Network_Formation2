**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

Thought: Since I currently have no connections and cannot see any colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players to gather information about their color and increase my chances of reaching a consensus.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 0 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and therefore no information about other players' colors


I need to purchase an edge to one of the agents (e.g., agent 228) to gain visibility into their color. This will help me decide whether to declare my color as '0' or '1' based on their choice.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only connected neighbor (agent 228) hasn't declared a color yet


I should purchase an edge to them for 0.03 to reveal their color. This will help me decide whether to declare my own color as 0 or 1 based on their choice, aiming for consensus and maximizing my payout.

You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 228:

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to declare my color as '1' since my projected reward for choosing '1' is higher, and even though my only connected player (agent 228) has not yet chosen a color, this choice maximizes my potential payoff. If agent 228 chooses '1'


I will be in a good position for consensus; if they choose '0', at least I will still secure better potential returns even if consensus fails.
