**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and all players appear to have no color declared


I need to purchase an edge to a player to connect with them. This will allow me to see their color and potentially facilitate consensus. I should choose a player to purchase an edge to in hopes of revealing their color.

Thought: Since I have no connected players and cannot see any colors


I need to purchase an edge to a player to gather information about their color. I should choose a player to connect with to increase my chances of reaching consensus before time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors with declared colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players not in my colors dictionary. This will allow me to gather information on their color and help move towards a consensus. Given my projected rewards


I should aim for consensus on color 1, as it provides a higher payout. I will buy an edge with one of the players who has a degree greater than 0 to maximize my chances of finding out more information about their color.
