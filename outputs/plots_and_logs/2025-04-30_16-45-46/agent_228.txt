**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the other agents to establish a connection and gather information about their color, increasing the chances of reaching consensus.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: I should purchase an edge to a player (such as agent 752, 545, 882, 968, 745, 633, or 972) to potentially gather information about their colors and get closer to reaching a consensus. Since I cannot see any colors currently, making an edge purchase is essential to maximize my earnings and increase the chance of consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I can only see that player 633 has chosen color '0' and the others are undeclared


I should declare my color as '0' to align with player 633 and aim for a consensus since that would maximize my projected rewards. If I wait or declare '1'


I risk not reaching consensus and earning nothing.
