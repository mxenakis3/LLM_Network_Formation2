You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connected players and my color is undeclared


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the players (e.g., player 228) to gain access to their color information, which will help me make a more informed decision about my color choice and possibly reach consensus. However


I must also consider that this edge purchase will reduce my potential payout, so I should proceed carefully.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I can only see that player 228 has not yet declared a color, and my current colors dictate a potential payoff leaning towards color 1


I should declare my color as '1' to potentially align with the majority consensus if player 228 also chooses '1' once they declare. However, if they end up choosing '0', my payout will lower significantly. To safeguard my position while awaiting their color declaration


I could consider purchasing an edge to another player who currently does not have a declared color, which might improve my chances for better payoff alignment in the future. Thus


I will declare my color as '1' for now.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and my only connected neighbor (agent 228) has not chosen a color yet


I should declare color "1" right away. The projected reward for color "1" is slightly higher than that for color "0," and it is crucial to make a decision quickly with only 1.354 seconds remaining. This way


I can maximize my payoff based on the information I currently have.
