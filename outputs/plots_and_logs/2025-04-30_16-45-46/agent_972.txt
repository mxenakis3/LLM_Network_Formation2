**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected agents in order to gather information and potentially influence the consensus color before time runs out.

Thought: Since I have no connected colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected players to gather more information about their colors, which could help me decide on a color to maximize my payout.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I do not have any direct connections or see any colors from neighbors


I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected players to gain visibility of their color. This will help me decide what color to declare and work towards achieving consensus before the time runs out. I will prioritize purchasing an edge to the player with the highest degree or minimal distance, if they become visible.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should declare my color as '1' to potentially align with the projected highest rewards, and since there's no consensus reached with no neighbors


I need to take action now before time runs out.
