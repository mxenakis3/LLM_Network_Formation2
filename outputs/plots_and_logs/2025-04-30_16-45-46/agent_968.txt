You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and no information about their colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected players to gain insight into their color choices, which will help influence my own decision for reaching a consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently do not have any connected players and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to a player with the lowest degree, which will enhance my chances of connecting with others and potentially achieving consensus. Player 752 has the lowest degree (0) and is unconnected, so I will purchase an edge to them. This will allow me to see their color and contribute to reaching a consensus if they declare their color.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I only have one neighbor (player 752) who has not yet declared a color


I should declare my color as '0' now. This way, if player 752 also chooses '0' shortly, we may potentially reach consensus on '0', which has the higher payoff of 3. If they declare a color of '1', then at least I am declared and can still aim for a consensus strategy based on updated information. Waiting is not an option due to the limited time remaining.
