**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and cannot see any colors


I need to purchase an edge to one of the players in order to gain visibility on their color and increase my chances of reaching consensus. I'll choose the player with the lowest ID (228) to start gathering information.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and my only neighbor (agent 228) has not yet chosen a color


I should choose color '0' to take advantage of the higher projected reward of 2.97 before time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have only one connected player (agent 228) who hasn't chosen a color yet


I should wait for them to declare their color. If I declare a color now without knowing their choice


I risk not achieving consensus and potentially receiving zero payoff. I will wait to see what agent 228 chooses before making a decision.

I need to act quickly. I should declare my color as '0' to maximize my projected reward and encourage player 228 to also choose '0' for consensus before time runs out.
