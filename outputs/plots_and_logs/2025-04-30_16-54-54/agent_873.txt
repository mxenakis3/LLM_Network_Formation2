**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and no knowledge of other players' colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the agents (for instance, agent 449) to gather information about their color, which will help me decide on my own color for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I only have one connected player (agent 449) whose color is currently undeclared


I should wait for them to declare their color before making a decision. If they choose color 1


I could also declare color 1 to align with them and potentially maximize my payout. If they choose 0


I can then consider switching to 0 to aim for a consensus. Given the time remaining


I should not take any immediate actions and observe the situation.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only connected neighbor (agent 449) has not yet declared their color


I should quickly declare my color as '1' to incentivize them to do the same for a higher payout.
