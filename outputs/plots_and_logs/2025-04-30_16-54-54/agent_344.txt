You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since all of my neighboring players have not declared their colors and I have no connections to other players


I should purchase edges to one or more players to gather information about their colors. This will allow me to make a more informed decision regarding my own color to potentially achieve consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the available players to potentially learn their color and work toward a consensus before time expires. I will choose a player strategically, such as one with low degrees, as this might indicate fewer connections and more opportunity to influence their color choice.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no neighbors with declared colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players, as this will give me visibility into their color, which can help me decide my color and work towards achieving consensus. I should choose the player with the least degree or the shortest path for potential better connectivity in the future.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and cannot see any colors of other players


I should choose color '0'. Choosing '0' will maximize my potential payoff, as I can earn 3 if all players reach consensus on this color. Since I have no information about others' choices, choosing a color is crucial to avoid receiving nothing.
