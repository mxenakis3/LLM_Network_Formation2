**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected agents to gather information on their colors. This will help me make a more informed decision about which color to choose for the consensus.

Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the players with the lowest degree to gain visibility into their color. This will help me make a more informed decision about which color to choose for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no neighbors with declared colors, which means I can't gauge their inclinations. Given that I have2.576 seconds left


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the players (perhaps the one with the lowest node degree for better connectivity) to see their color before the time expires, as reaching consensus is crucial for a payout.
