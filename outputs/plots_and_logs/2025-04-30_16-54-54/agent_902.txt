You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am not currently connected to any players and all my neighbors have not chosen a color


I need to purchase an edge to one of them to establish a connection and have visibility into their colors. This is necessary to make an informed decision about my color choice and maximize my potential payoff.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and I am currently undeclared


I need to purchase an edge to a player in order to have visibility of their color. I can then make a more informed decision regarding my own color to help reach consensus. Since I have multiple options with players who have no current color declared


I should prioritize purchasing an edge to one of those players before time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and my color is undeclared


I should declare color '0' immediately to potentially set the consensus towards that color and maximize my projected reward of 3. There isn't enough time to purchase edges for gathering information, so taking action now is my best option.
