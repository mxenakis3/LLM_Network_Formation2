**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the players not currently in my colors dictionary to establish a connection and potentially gather more information about their color, which will help me in deciding my final color choice before the time expires.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no visible neighbors with colors


I should purchase edges to the players with the lowest shortest-path distances to maximize my chances of gathering information about their colors. I will prioritize purchasing edges to the players who are reachable from my current position.
