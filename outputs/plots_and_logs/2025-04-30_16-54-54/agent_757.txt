**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

I need to purchase an edge to another player in order to potentially gather information about their color and work towards achieving consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am not connected to any other players and all my neighbors have not chosen a color


I should purchase an edge to one of the players to reveal their color and work towards achieving consensus. This will enhance my chances of aligning with their chosen color and maximizing my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connected colors, which means I cannot gauge what color my potential neighbors have chosen. Since my color is currently undeclared


I should declare color '1' to maximize my chances of a payout, as it has a higher projected reward than color '0'. Additionally, doing nothing right now could lead to no consensus and zero payout.

I should choose color '1' as it offers a higher reward and hope that my future neighbors also choose this color for consensus.
