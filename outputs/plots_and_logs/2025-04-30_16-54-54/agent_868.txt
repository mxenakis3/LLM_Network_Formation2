**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I am not connected to any other players and my color is undeclared. Since I have no information about potential neighbors' colors


I should purchase an edge to an unconnected player to gather more information and increase the chances of reaching a consensus. This will allow me to potentially align my color with theirs and maximize my payoff.

I should purchase an edge to one of the available players to gather information about their color. This will help me decide whether to align my color to 0 or 1 to maximize my payoff based on what I observe.

Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and cannot see any colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the players (for example, player 902) to gather information about their color. This will help me make a more informed decision about which color to choose in order to achieve consensus and maximize my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and only connected to player 902 who has not chosen a color yet


I should wait and see if they make a choice. If they declare a color


I can then decide whether to follow their choice or make a decision based on the projected rewards. With time running low, it's better to not take any action that could lead to more uncertainty.
