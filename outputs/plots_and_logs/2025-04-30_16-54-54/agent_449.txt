**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no direct connections to any other players


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the unconnected players in order to gain insight into their color options. This could help me determine whether I should align with color 0 or color 1 for a potential payout. I'll choose a player and spend 0.03 on an edge.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am connected only to one player (agent 873) who hasn't declared their color yet


I should wait for them to choose a color. If they declare a color before time expires


I can decide to match their color to reach consensus and maximize my payoff. If they don't declare and the time runs out


I will earn nothing.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since there is only one connected player (agent 873) who has not declared their color


I should purchase an edge to agent 873. This way


I'll find out their color and can make a decision to declare the same color to ensure consensus and maximize my payout. Buying the edge is crucial because I need to know the status of my only connection to avoid earning nothing when time runs out.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 873: 
{873: None}
