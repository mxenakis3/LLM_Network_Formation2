**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 0 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected colors and there is no information about other players' colors


I should purchase an edge to one of the other players, hoping to gain visibility on their color. This will help me make an informed decision about what color to choose for consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected colors and my current color is undeclared


I need to purchase an edge to one of the players (preferably one of degree 0 like player 771, 431, 781, 232, or 672) to gather information about their color and work towards a consensus.

I should choose color '0' to maximize my projected reward to 1.97, while also hoping that player 771 decides to choose '0' as well to achieve consensus and secure my payoff before time expires.
