You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I am currently undetermined in color and have no direct neighbors to base my decision on, which means I should purchase an edge to one of the unconnected agents to gather information on their colors, decreasing my risk of not reaching consensus and optimizing for a potential payout.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and my color is still undeclared


I should purchase an edge to one of the other players, as this may help me discover their colors and work towards a consensus before time runs out. It’s better to have some visibility than remain completely isolated.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and cannot see any colors


I need to purchase edges to a few players in order to gather information about their colors. This will help me make an informed decision about which color to declare for reaching consensus and maximizing my payoff. However


I should consider that I only have limited time remaining, so I should act quickly.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I should declare my color as '1' since I have potential projected rewards of 2 if I assume the majority color is '0', but the presence of player 160 (who is undeclared) may still mean there's a chance for consensus. Therefore, declaring '1' might help in tilting the consensus towards that color and securing the payout.
