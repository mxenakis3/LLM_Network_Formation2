You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

Thought: Since I have no connections and my color is undeclared


I should purchase an edge to a player in order to see colors and increase the chance of reaching consensus. This may help me determine a beneficial color to choose for maximizing my payout.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no neighbors in the network and cannot see any colors


I should purchase an edge to an unconnected player to potentially gather information about their color. This will help me decide on my color and potentially reach a consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors with declared colors


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the players to gather information about their color. Considering the time remaining is limited, purchasing an edge is my best action to potentially reach a consensus before time expires. I'll choose to purchase an edge to a player with an available connection, as that may lead to discovering a consensus color and maximizing my payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connections and my color is undeclared


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the available players. This would allow me to see their color and make an informed choice to maximize my payoff, as consensus is crucial for earning anything. I need to choose a player with a connection and less influence on the final outcome (like a neighbor with no established color) to minimize risk.
