**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and have no neighbors in the network


I should purchase an edge to a player (such as player 649) to possibly gather more information about their color. This will increase my chances of reaching a consensus and maximizing my potential payoff.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am connected only to player 649, who has not yet declared a color


I should wait and observe their color choice before making a decision. If they declare a color, it will inform my choice for maximum payoff, either to match their color or to choose '0' if I can confirm they will declare '0'.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my only connected neighbor (agent 649) has not yet declared a color


I should wait for them to choose a color. If they select 0


I should also choose 0 to ensure consensus and maximize my payout. If they choose 1


I can then consider purchasing an edge to another player to see if I can still steer towards consensus. For now, making no moves is the best course of action to avoid any unnecessary risks.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and I can see that one of my connected neighbors (agent 649) has already chosen color "1," I should also choose color "1" to align with them. This will help me achieve consensus with my neighbor and maximize my payoff. Alternatively, if I wait, the neighboring player 672 may choose a different color, which could lead to a lack of consensus. Thus


I should declare my color as "1" immediately.
