**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and therefore cannot see any colors


I need to purchase an edge to a player to gather information about their colors. This will allow me to determine if I should select color 0 or 1 to help achieve global consensus. However


I must be cautious about my financial deductions and ensure I make a strategic choice after purchasing the edge.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connected neighbors and cannot see any colors


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the unconnected agents to hopefully gather information about their colors, as waiting with an undeclared color could lead to no consensus being achieved. Given that I have less than 3 seconds left


I should act quickly to gain information that could help me decide on my color or reach consensus.
