**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors and knowing that I cannot declare a color without information from others


I should purchase an edge to a nearby player to gain insights into their color. This will help me make an informed decision on which color to declare to increase the chances of reaching consensus.

You have attempted to purchase an edge 1 to an agent that does not exist. Your degrees and shortest path dictionary contain the full set of players of the game:

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connections and my color is undeclared


I should consider purchasing an edge to a player who has a degree of 1. This would allow me to connect with at least one other player and gather information about their color, which is essential for making an informed decision about my own color choice before time runs out.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected players and my color is undeclared


I should choose color '1' because it has a higher projected reward (2) than color '0' (3). Even though choosing color '0' has a slightly higher payoff, without any connections that can lead to consensus


I cannot rely on anyone else to match my choice. Thus, it's safer to make a choice now.
