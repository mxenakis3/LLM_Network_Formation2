You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected neighbors in the network and I am currently undeclared


I should consider purchasing an edge to one of the unconnected players. This would allow me to reveal their color and potentially reach a consensus. I should choose a player to purchase an edge to, as my current payoff is zero without any neighbors.

I should purchase an edge to one of the players with a degree of 1 (either agent 998 or 649) to gather information about their color and increase my chances of reaching consensus.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and my only connected player (998) has not declared a color


I should choose color '1' to optimize my projected reward of 2.97, as pursuing consensus on '0' is uncertain given that I cannot see my connected player's color. Additionally, since the time is running low, it's crucial to declare quickly to avoid missing the consensus opportunity.
