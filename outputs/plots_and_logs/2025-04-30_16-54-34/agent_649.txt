**System** 
You run in a loop of Thought and Action. 
First, generate a thought about a logical action to take in the game. 
Example session #1:
Prompt: You have no neighbors in the network
Thought: I need to purchase an edge to a neighbor to agent 0 in order to gather information about other player's colors.
Example session #2:
Prompt: All of your neighbors have color 1, but your color is undeclared
Thought: I should change my color to '1' in order to achieve consensus and receive a payout when time expires.
Example session #3:   
Thought: I should do nothing and wait for time to expire. Then I will receive my reward.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connected colors and cannot see any player's color


I should purchase an edge to one of the players (e.g., player 998) to potentially gather information about their color and increase my chances of reaching a consensus by having visible colors. This will allow me to make a more informed decision regarding my own color choice.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I can only see one connected player (agent 998) whose color is currently undeclared


I should choose color '1' in order to potentially align with whatever color they choose when they declare. If they also choose '1'


I will gain a payoff of 3 if consensus is reached, and it appears that my projected reward is higher for color '1' than for color '0'.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am currently undeclared and only see one connected player (agent 998) who has not chosen their color yet (indicated by null)


I should purchase an edge to agent 998. This will allow me to see their color, and based on that information


I can make a more informed decision about which color to choose to maximize my payout before the time expires.
