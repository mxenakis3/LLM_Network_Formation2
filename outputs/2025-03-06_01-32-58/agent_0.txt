Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other agents in the network, as indicated by my empty colors dictionary. I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player so I can start observing their color and make a more informed decision about which color to eventually set for myself. Since no consensus has been reached


I don't incur any costs yet; thus, purchasing my first edge is a good starting action. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will attempt to connect with player 1 as my first move.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections with established colors, but I can see that all connected players' colors are undeclared. I need to purchase edges to other players strategically to secure more connections and possibly reach a consensus for color 0, as it provides a higher projected payoff. 
Action: I will start by purchasing an edge to player 2, who is within my shortest path distance, to increase my available connections.
Action: purchase_edge(2)
