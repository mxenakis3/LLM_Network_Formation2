Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections in the network and need to purchase edges to connect with other players. Since all players currently have a degree of 0 and my colors dictionary is empty


I can purchase edges to any player. My goal is to explore connections and hopefully find a consensus on colors, preferably 0 for the maximum payoff. I will start by purchasing an edge to a neighbor (player 1) as the first move. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)


Called purchase_edge and received value (2, 1).

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently only have one connection, which is with agent 1 who has not yet declared their color. Given that we are both undeclared, our next action should be to reach a consensus. If I can convince agent 1 to go for color 0


I would ensure the best possible payoff. Since I have no other connections


I should consider if I want to purchase connections to other players to gather more information or possibly influence more players to choose color 0. With limited time remaining


I should act quickly.
