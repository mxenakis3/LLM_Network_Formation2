**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connections to any other agents, and I need to make a connection to potentially influence the color choice in the network. The current projected reward for a consensus of 0 is higher, so I should aim for that. I need to purchase an edge to another agent to establish a connection. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I'm choosing neighbor_id as 0 arbitrarily since I have no information on who to connect to.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my situation in the network. I currently have one connection, which is to player 0. Player 0's color is undeclared, so I can't base my decision on their color yet. Since my projected payoff for a consensus of 0 is higher than that for a consensus of 1


I should aim to create favorable conditions for a consensus on color 0. I can purchase a connection to another player who is not in my colors dictionary to gain more information and potentially influence the outcome towards color 0. The connections I can possibly purchase are to any player identified by their shortest path distances. 
Action: purchase_edge(8)  # I will purchase an edge to player 8, who has a degree of 1 and contributes to my reach in the network. This gives me a chance to form a better strategy.
