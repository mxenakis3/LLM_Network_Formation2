**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no connections in the network, as shown by the empty colors dictionary. To maximize my potential payoff


I need to start purchasing edges to connect with other players. Since all players currently have no connections


I need to choose one to buy an edge to. I will start by purchasing an edge to player 0, as it is the first player in the degree dictionary. This will allow me to see their color in the next turn.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have an existing connection to player 0, whose color is undeclared. My goal is to maximize my payoff, and right now, my projected reward for a consensus of color 0 is higher than that for color 1. Since I only have one known connection


I need to decide whether to wait for player 0 to declare, or if I should purchase edges to potentially gather more information or influence the outcome. Given that there is no consensus yet and I can still influence the game, purchasing an edge to gather more data or to connect with other players could be beneficial. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1 to see their color.
