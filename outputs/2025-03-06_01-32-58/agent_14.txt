**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and my colors dictionary is empty


I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player. Since all other nodes have infinite shortest path distances and zero degrees


I should start by purchasing an edge to a player with the lowest ID that I can connect to, in order to increase my visibility in the network.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # Attempting to purchase an edge to player 0.
