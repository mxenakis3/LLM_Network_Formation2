**Agent**: 
Thought: I am currently agent 11 with no existing connections and no colors declared. I need to purchase edges to other players to increase my chances of forming a consensus color, either 0 or 1. Given that all nodes have a degree of 0 and the shortest path distances indicate I’m isolated from everyone


I will need to buy edges to connect with other agents.  
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will attempt to purchase an edge to the first agent, as there are no connections right now.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I have a connection to player 0, who has not yet declared their color. I also have projected rewards depending on the consensus color. Given that the projected reward for consensus color 1 is higher than for color 0, it may be beneficial to encourage a consensus for color 1. Since there are many undeclared players around me


I should consider purchasing edges to increase my visibility and the chance for color 1 consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1 to see their color.
