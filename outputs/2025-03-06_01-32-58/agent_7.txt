Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, and all shortest path distances and degrees indicate that I am isolated. To increase my chances of forming a consensus


I need to establish a connection with another player. I can take advantage of my undecided color and observe how others play. I need to purchase an edge to a player who is likely to have connections to others. Since the degree of all nodes is 0


I'll start by purchasing an edge to a node with the lowest possible unique ID among available players to ensure I can start gathering information.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will start by purchasing an edge to player 0.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I observe that I have one connection, which is to player 0, and their color is currently undeclared. My projected rewards for color consensus suggest that picking color 1 has a higher payoff than color 0. However


I need to determine if I should purchase additional edges to other players to increase my knowledge of their colors. Since I only see player 0's color and they haven't chosen yet


I should consider purchasing an edge to another player. Among the options


I see players with shorter path distances, but I need to pick one with a higher degree of connections to maximize my chances of winning. Player 1 has a degree of 2, which might increase my network.
