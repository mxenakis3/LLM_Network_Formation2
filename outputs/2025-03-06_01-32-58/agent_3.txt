Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no existing connections, which means I cannot see any colors of other agents yet. Purchasing edges to other players will allow me to see their colors in the next turn, which will help me decide my strategy. I should purchase an edge to increase my chances of seeing color choices and potentially forming a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to the first agent (ID 0) as a starting point.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently only have one connection (to player 0) and their color is undeclared. Since I need to reach a consensus for maximum payoff


I should consider either purchasing additional edges to gather more information about player colors or setting my color now. However, with my current projection, a consensus of color 1 yields a higher payoff. I should purchase an edge to another player to see their color before making a decision on my own color.
