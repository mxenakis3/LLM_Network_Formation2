Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no existing connections


I need to purchase an edge to begin interacting with other players. All players currently have a degree of 0 and are not connected to anyone, but I can purchase an edge to any of them. I should choose to connect to a player who might help me achieve a consensus to maximize my payoff.
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to player 0.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges or set my color, balancing the potential rewards from different consensus scenarios. I see that there are two neighbors connected to me, both of whom have not declared a color. To maximize my potential payoff


I should consider purchasing edges to connect to more players to see their colors in the next turn. Currently, declaring color 1 gives me the highest projected reward. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2, who I currently do not have a connection with.
