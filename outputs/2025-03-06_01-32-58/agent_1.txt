**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections and my color is undeclared. I should purchase an edge to connect with another player to potentially gain information about their color, which may help me in achieving a consensus. Since all players have a degree of 0


I can only purchase a connection to one of the other agents. I will select neighbor_id 2 to expand my connections.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to establish more connections to other players in the network to improve my chances of reaching a consensus on color. The only connection I have right now is with player 2, whose color is undeclared. Given that I can see their color next turn, it would be beneficial to purchase an edge to another player to maximize my potential payoff. 
Action: purchase_edge(6)  # I will purchase a connection to player 6 as they have a degree of 1, and I can see their color next turn.
