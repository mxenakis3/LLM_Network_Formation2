**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, and all other players in the network are also undeclared. I need to make a connection to another player to start engaging in the game. The best approach would be to purchase an edge to player 0 who is available and has the potential to connect me to more players in the network. This will help to gauge the colors of others and make an informed decision in the next turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I can see that the only connection I currently have is with player 0, who has not yet declared their color. I need to decide whether to purchase more edges to increase my visibility of other players' colors or set my color. Given that I have a projected reward for a consensus of 1 that is higher than for 0, it might be beneficial to connect with more players to gauge their colors before making a decision.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to make a strategic decision on whether to purchase edges or set my color. Given that my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0


I should consider purchasing edges to see if I can persuade more players to choose color 1. I currently have two connections, both of which are undeclared. I can buy edges to other players, especially to those with a low degree that may help influence the decision. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2, as they have relatively few connections and may be swayed.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I am connected to three players, two of whom are undeclared and one who has chosen color 0. The projected rewards indicate that I will likely benefit more from a consensus on color 1. However


I also need to consider the potential for the two undeclared players to choose their colors. Since color 1 has a higher projected reward, it might be strategic to purchase an edge to another player who is not in my colors dictionary and try to gain more visibility and influence over the game's outcome.
Action: purchase_edge(3)  # I will purchase a connection to player 3, who is currently undeclared and has the least number of connections. This should provide me with additional insights into the colors present in the network.
