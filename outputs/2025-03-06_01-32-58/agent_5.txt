Thought: I currently have no connections and cannot see the colors of any other players. To increase my chances of achieving consensus


I should purchase an edge to connect to another player. Since all the nodes have a degree of 0, it seems I can purchase an edge to any player who is not currently connected to me. This will allow me to see their color in the next turn. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # Assuming I choose to connect to player 0.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I am connected to two players (4 and 0), both of whom have not declared their colors yet. Since my projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for a consensus of 0


I should try to encourage a consensus towards color 1. To achieve this


I need to purchase connections to other players to gather more information about their colors and potentially influence the network's consensus. The players that are reachable but not connected to are player 1, player 2, player 3, player 6, player 8, player 11, player 12, player 15, player 13, player 14, player 16, and player 17. Purchasing edges to these players could help me see their colors and potentially increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I choose to purchase an edge to player 1 first.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to maximize my projected payoff. Currently


I have connections with players 0, 1, and 4, all of whom have undeclared colors. The consensus for color 1 gives a higher projected payoff than color 0, so I should consider persuading more players to choose color 1. I can purchase edges to increase my visibility and possibly influence others' choices. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will try to connect to player 2, who is not currently in my colors dictionary.
