Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections in the network, and therefore, cannot see any colors. To maximize my projected payoff


I should purchase edges to establish connections with other players. Since all players have a degree of 0 and there are inf distances to others


I should start by purchasing one edge to an available player. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I'll purchase an edge to player 0.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase an edge to another player or set my color since I currently have a connection to player 0 who has not declared their color. I should weigh the potential payoff of reaching a consensus versus spending money to gain visibility on the network. Since my current projected reward for a consensus of 0 is higher than for 1, it may be beneficial to pursue connections that might lead to or maintain a consensus for 0.
Action: purchase_edge(6)  # I see player 6 with the shortest path distance of 2 and degree of 1; I will purchase an edge to them to increase my visibility.
