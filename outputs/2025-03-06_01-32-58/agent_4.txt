**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no existing connections and therefore no colors to observe, my best option is to purchase an edge to connect with another player in order to gather information about their colors. This will help me in deciding my color, especially since I can see that a consensus of color 0 has a higher projected payoff than color 1. I will choose to purchase an edge to player 5.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to assess the situation and make a strategic decision. Right now


I have one connection (player 5) whose color is undeclared, and I can't see anyone else's colors. To increase my chances of achieving consensus on color 0


I might need to connect with more players to gather information on their colors. The rewards for a consensus of color 0 is higher than color 1, so I should aim to maximize that potential payoff by either purchasing edges or setting my color once I have enough information.
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase a connection to player 1 as they have a degree of 1 and are not currently in my colors dictionary.
