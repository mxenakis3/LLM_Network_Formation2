Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections, and all agents are currently undeclared. I need to purchase an edge to another player to gain visibility into their color. Since all players have a degree of 0


I'll need to choose a neighbor strategically to maximize my chances for a future consensus.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have an undeclared color and my only connected neighbor (agent 0) has not declared their color yet. I need to decide whether to set my color to 0 or 1 based on the projected rewards, or purchase an edge to another player to gather more information. Based on the current projected rewards, a consensus of 1 gives me a higher payoff. I can connect to new players who might influence the consensus.
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will purchase an edge to player 1 to gain more information about their color, despite their low degree connection.
