**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players in the network and cannot see anyone's colors. To maximize my potential payoff


I should make a connection to another player, as this might allow me to influence the decision on colors for a consensus. Since I need to purchase connections


I will buy an edge to a neighboring player. However, since I don't know any available neighboring player yet


I can only purchase edges to those with degrees or shortest path distances that are non-infinite. Since all are "inf" currently


I should first check if any players are available for connection.  
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # Attempting to purchase an edge to player 0. Choosing the first player as a trial.
