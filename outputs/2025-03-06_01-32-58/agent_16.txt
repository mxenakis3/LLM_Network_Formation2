**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any players in the network, and thus cannot see their colors. The degree and shortest path distances indicate that I am isolated from all players. In this situation


I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player to start gathering information about their colors. Since I see no other connected players


I will choose a player to connect to that is closest in terms of the shortest path, which will allow me to take my first action to potentially influence the consensus in the network. 
Action: purchase_edge(17)  # I choose to connect to player 17 as the best option.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have one connection (agent 17) who has not declared their color. Since my maximum projected payoff for a consensus of color 0 is higher than that of color 1


I want to encourage that outcome. However


I also need more connections to increase the chances of achieving a consensus. Therefore


I should consider purchasing an edge to another player to increase my visibility of their colors, especially since I do not yet have any declared colors. 
Action: purchase_edge(1)  # I will buy an edge to agent 1, who has a degree of 2 and is a potential connection.

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase an edge or set my color, considering that there are two players connected to me who have not declared their colors yet. Since my projected reward for a consensus of color 0 is higher than for color 1


I should focus on reaching a consensus for color 0 if possible, but first


I should assess if any additional connections could improve my chances of achieving this. Given that both of my current connections are undeclared, it is uncertain what direction they will take. I will evaluate the importance of possibly purchasing an edge to a neighbor to gain more visibility on their colors. 
Action: I will consider purchasing an edge to a player that is closest to me based on my shortest path distance and has not declared a color. I should purchase an edge to player 2, who has a shortest path distance of 2, as they will provide me more information when the colors refresh.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Time is running out, and I need to make a decision quickly. Since I still have connections with players 17 and 1 who have not declared their colors


I should focus on gaining more information about the network. I will purchase an edge to player 2 as they have a shortest path distance of 2, which will allow me to see their color next turn, thus helping me decide my color based on the network dynamics.
