I should aim to gather more information about other players' colors and possibly switch to color 1. Agent 0 is already connected, so I will focus on purchasing edges to agents with lower shortest path distances.

I currently have two connections (agents 0 and 1) whose colors are both undeclared. I should consider purchasing edges to potentially increase the number of players declaring color 1.

I will start with purchasing an edge to a neighboring player.

Thought: I need to evaluate the situation of my connections and potential actions to maximize my payoff. My connected neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3) have a mix of declared and undeclared colors. Since there is a consensus for color 1 that yields a higher projected reward than color 0


I should consider purchasing an edge to more connections that might help achieve a color consensus of 1. The colors of neighbors 0 and 1 are undeclared, and I need to act quickly with the game time running out.
