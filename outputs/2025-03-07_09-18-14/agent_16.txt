I can expect a payoff of 2.97, which is higher than 1.97 for color 1. Since my color is undeclared


I should consider connecting to another player to gather more information. I can see that all my shortest path distances are valid connections except for player 7. The best candidate to connect with could be either player 1 or player 11, as they have connections that might influence the consensus. I should purchase the edge to player 11 for now, which is within my shortest path distance.

I should consider purchasing edges to at least a couple of other players, preferably those with higher degrees, to gain visibility into more colors and potentially sway the consensus.

Format your response as:
Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, and I cannot take any more actions. Although I still have undeclared connections, the majority of my connections have declared color 1. This means that the consensus is likely to end up being on color 1, resulting in a lower payoff for me. Since I cannot influence any decisions now


I must conclude the game without making any further moves. 
Action: finish()


Error calling finish with parameters []: ReActAgent.finish() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
