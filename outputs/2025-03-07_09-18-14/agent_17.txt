Thought: I currently have no existing connections, as indicated by my colors dictionary being empty. I need to establish a connection with another agent to potentially influence the color choice of the network. Since all other players have infinite shortest path distances and I've noted their degree is zero, it means we have no immediate connections. I can purchase edges to anyone, but I will need to spend some of my projected payoff to do so. Given my projected rewards of 2 for color 0 and 3 for color 1


I want to determine the best first move. Since I have no knowledge of others' colors yet, it's wise to connect with an agent who might have a better chance at helping achieve a consensus before setting my own color.

I should consider setting my color to 1. However, because I do not know the color of node 0 yet, it might be wise to establish more connections to gather more information before making any final decisions. I should consider purchasing connections to nodes with shorter path distances that might have more influence in the decision-making process.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my color is currently 1 and I have several connections (some undeclared)


I should consider purchasing connections to players with undecided colors. This will improve my chances of reaching a consensus for color 1, which has a higher projected reward. I can see that I am currently connected to several players with 'None' as their color, so I should focus on purchasing those connections. I will purchase an edge to player 2.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since my color is currently 1 and I have multiple connections that are still undeclared


I need to focus on securing additional connections. I will purchase an edge to player 3, as they are not already in my colors dictionary. This could potentially help in achieving a consensus towards color 1 and maximizing my projected reward, especially since I cannot see the colors of the players with undeclared statuses yet.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I am still unable to purchase edges to players I am already connected to


I need to choose a different player to connect with who has not yet declared their color. I will purchase an edge to player 4, who is not currently in my colors dictionary. Establishing this connection could influence the outcome of the game and help in achieving a consensus towards color 1. Time is running out, and I must act to secure my position.
