**Agent**:

Since my projected reward for a consensus of color 1 is higher (2.97) than for color 0 (1.97), my goal should be to gather more information about the players leaning towards color 1. I should consider purchasing an edge to a player I can afford who I suspect may lean towards color 1. 
I see that the players with the shortest path distance of 2 are 1, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, and 17 – I’ll choose one of them to purchase an edge to.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, which means I need to finalize my actions. Since I have already set my color to 1 and have multiple connections with colors indicating support for color 1, my best chance is to maintain that color. I will finish the turn as there are no more actions left to take.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, indicating that I can no longer perform any actions. Since I have already set my color to 1 and have connections that largely support this choice


I am poised for a higher projected reward for a consensus of color 1. Therefore


I will conclude my turn.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game has already expired; however


I still see my color is set to 1 and my connected players also lean toward supporting this color. Since I have no more actions to take and the game is no longer active


I will conclude my turn. The consensus for color 1 is favorable for my projected reward, meaning I could still benefit if the game were to conclude.
