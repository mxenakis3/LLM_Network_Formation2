Thought: Since I have no connections and cannot see the colors of any other players


I should purchase an edge to connect with another player. This will allow me to start gathering information about the colors of others in the network. My goal is to determine the best strategy for achieving consensus on color 0, which has the highest projected payoff. I will purchase an edge to the first available neighbor, which is player 11 (since it's the next ID in the shortest path distance).

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to determine the best action to maximize my potential payoff. Currently


I have one connection whose color is not declared. Since my potential reward is higher for a consensus of color 0


I should focus on increasing my connections to gather more information on other agents’ colors. I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players or set my color. Since I don’t know the colors of many players and I potentially have time to purchase more edges, it may be wise to make a purchase. 
Observing the degrees and shortest path distances


I see I can purchase edges to players: 7 (distance inf, degree 0), 12 (distance inf, degree 1), 13 (distance inf, degree 1), 14 (distance inf, degree 0), 16 (distance inf, degree 0), and 17 (distance inf, degree 0). However, the useful candidates that may declare their colors and have connections would be agents closer to me. The player with degree 6 (which is me) shows I can connect to 11.

I should purchase edges to other players that I can connect with, as this might provide me with more colors to observe. My options are limited to purchasing edges to players whose colors I cannot currently see.
