I can purchase edges to any player. I will purchase an edge to player 3 since the nearest available node isn't connected to anyone else, which could give me a chance to form connections.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: The colors of my connections show that many players have declared color '1', which already has a slight majority. If I set my color to '1', my projected reward would be lower than if I can convince enough players for color '0'. Since time is running out and I have several connections still 'undeclared'


I should purchase edges to connections that might increase my influence towards color '0'. However


I need to act quickly given the time constraint. I will purchase an edge to agent 10, who is currently undeclared, as they have a decent degree of connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, which means I can no longer perform any actions. Currently


I have an undeclared color and based on the colors of my connections, most players have selected color '1'. I need to analyze the implications of my current strategy and how I may have positioned myself in the network to maximize my potential payoff. There was a chance to purchase edges or set my color, but now all I can do is wait for the game results without having made a definitive choice.
