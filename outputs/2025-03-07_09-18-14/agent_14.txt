Thought: The game time has expired, and I cannot take any actions. I have missed the opportunity to set my color or purchase edges to influence the outcome. As my color is currently undeclared

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired again, and I am unable to make any decisions or actions. My current color remains undeclared, and I will not earn any payoff this round. I realize that I need to decide more quickly in the future and consider how to navigate the game better when I have the time to act. There are many possible connections and color settings I could have pursued that might have improved my chances of achieving a consensus.
