I need to begin by purchasing edges to connect with other nodes. This will allow me to see their colors and potentially work towards a consensus.

Thought: I see that I have two connections (to nodes 2 and 4) that have not yet declared their colors. It's possible that they could either choose color 0 or 1, which affects my projected payoff. I currently have a higher projected reward for consensus of color 1. To potentially increase my chances of reaching consensus


I might want to purchase connections to other players who could influence the consensus. Since players 1 and 2 could potentially influence my results more than those who are not connected to me


I should consider purchasing an edge. Player 1 has a degree of 1 and is two steps away. It might be worth the investment, as I need more insight into their color to strategize effectively.

I need to decide on a strategy. I see that I could potentially win a higher payoff if the whole network chooses color 1. My current projected reward for a consensus of 1 is 2.97, which is higher than for 0 (1.97). Since I am already connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 who have not declared their colors


I should probably wait to see what color they choose before making a purchase. However, purchasing edges could give me access to other players who might help establish a consensus.

Thought: I am currently connected to five agents (0, 1, 2, 4, and 11), all of whom have not declared a color. Given the current payoff projections, it's better for me if the network reaches a consensus on color 1, where my projected reward would be 2.97. Since I have no declared colors among my connections


I need to consider purchasing an edge to another player who might help achieve that. However, if all my current connections choose color 0 and I don't have any other connections asserting color 1


I would benefit from buying edges to potentially establish a consensus. I'll check the degree of nodes I can buy connections to and consider purchasing one that may lead to a group favoring color 1.

**Agent**: 
Thought: Time is running out, and I need to either set my color or purchase additional edges to make an informed decision. I see several players who have declared color '1', and my projected reward for color '1' is higher than for color '0'. Since purchasing edges to undeclared players could give me more information about the network


I should do that. I need to maximize my chances of consensus quickly. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I will purchase an edge to player 0, who is currently undeclared.
