I should purchase edges to other players in the network. Since all nodes have a degree of 0


I cannot see any connected players, but I would like to connect with another player to potentially see their color. I'll start by purchasing an edge to the nearest available player, which is player 0, to begin forming connections.

I should aim to find additional connections either supporting color 0 or with undeclared colors, which I can influence. I'll start by purchasing an edge to agent 5 because it has a relatively strong degree connection and a shorter path distance to me.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that most of the players connected to me have chosen color 1, while some are still undeclared. Since the projected payoff for consensus of color 0 is higher than that of color 1


I should consider purchasing edges to more players to gather information about their colors. This will help me decide my color strategically. There are several players with a degree of connection that I can reach, and I should start by purchasing edges to those who might not yet be declared to maximize the chance of reaching a consensus. 
Action: purchase_edge(7)  # This will allow me to see the color of player 7 next turn.
