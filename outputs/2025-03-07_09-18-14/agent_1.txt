**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to make a decision that maximizes my projected payoff. Since my potential payoff for a consensus of color 1 (approximately 2.94) is higher than for color 0 (approximately 1.94)


I should aim to gather more information and possibly connect with players leaning towards color 1. I have several connections that are undeclared, so I could wait for their decisions. However, to better my position


I may consider purchasing an edge to another node to gain more visibility on their colors.
Action: I will purchase an edge to one of the nodes that I am not currently connected to. Given the available information


I will choose to purchase an edge to node 4 (as it has a degree of 2 and is within a reachable distance).

Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have players connected to me who have declared their color as 1, which strengthens my position. Since I want to increase the chances of achieving a consensus for color 1


I should purchase connections to players who have not declared their color yet, specifically those that can still influence the outcome. I can see that players 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 17 are currently "undeclared" and are within my connection reach.
