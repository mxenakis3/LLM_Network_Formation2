Thought: I need to connect with more players to increase my chances of determining the overall color choice in the network. My connections to players with 'None' as their color allows me to influence the consensus, so I should purchase edges to those players. Connecting to player 3 seems strategic since they are also undeclared, which adds to my chances of forming a consensus for color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(3)  # Connecting with player 3 who is undeclared.

Thought: I need to find a way to maximize my projected payoff by increasing the likelihood of a consensus on color 0. Currently


I have several undeclared connections, and I need to evaluate if purchasing an edge to any of those can help me gather more information or influence their colors. Player 4 has not declared their color, so I should purchase an edge to connect with them. This connection could potentially help sway the consensus towards color 0. 
Action: purchase_edge(4)  # Attempting to connect with player 4 who is undeclared.
