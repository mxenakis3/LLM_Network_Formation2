Thought: I currently have no connections, as my colors dictionary is empty.

Thought: I see that I have connections with agents 0 and 1, both of whom have not declared their color yet.

There are other agents available (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.) that I could connect with, but I need to consider the cost of purchasing edges.

Thought: I see that I currently have connections to three players (0, 1, and 2) who have not yet declared their colors. My current color is 1, and if all players sit on consensus for 1, my projected reward increases significantly. There is a strong incentive for me to try to influence the network toward consensus for color 1. However


I also need to ensure that the players I connect to are also leaning towards color 1. My connections so far are undetermined, which gives me a chance to reach a consensus by purchasing edges to more players. Since I can buy edges, it may be beneficial to connect to players who can provide insight into moving the consensus towards 1.
Given that I have a potential for higher rewards with consensus of 1 and knowing the state of undetermined players


I should look to connect with another player who may declare 1.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I see that I currently have some connections that are undeclared. My color is '1', and I have two connections that have also chosen '1'. This suggests that there is a potential consensus forming for color '1'. With only 11.7 seconds remaining


I need to consider whether to purchase a connection to another agent to potentially gather more color information or to set my color. Given that I'm already aligned with others towards '1'


I think it would be wise to purchase an edge with a player who is undeclared, particularly agent 3, who has a degree of 17, thus increasing my influence.
