I should purchase edges to other players in the network. Since I have no connections

**Agent**: 
Thought: I observe that I have connections to agents 3 and 5, both of whom have undeclared colors. To reach a consensus


I need to ensure that more players choose color 0, and to do so


I may need to either influence my current connections or purchase new connections to gather more information. Currently, my payoff for a consensus on color 0 is higher than that for color 1, so I should aim to prioritize connections that may lean towards color 0.
Action: I will purchase an edge to neighbor 2 to potentially get more connections and information about desired colors.
