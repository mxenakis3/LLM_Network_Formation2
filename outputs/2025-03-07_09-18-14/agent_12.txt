Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide whether to purchase edges to other players or set my color. Since many of my connections have already chosen color 1, it might be more beneficial to adopt that color. However, the consensus for color 0 offers a higher projected payoff if we can get the majority to agree. I should evaluate what players have not yet declared their colors and if purchasing edges can help me influence the outcome towards color 0.
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will purchase an edge to player 2 to see if I can get more connections to declare color 0.


**System**: 
You have attempted to purchase an edge to an agent with whom you are already connected. Your colors dictionary contains agent 2:

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired, which means I cannot take any further actions or influence the outcome. I need to accept that I will not earn any payoff because there is no potential for consensus and I currently have an undeclared color. My projected rewards for both colors show that color 0 was more favorable, but without taking decisive action


I am left with no further strategies to implement. 
Action: finish() 
Answer: The game has ended, and I did not earn any payoff due to the undeclared color and expiration of time.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired again, so I cannot take any further actions. I remain undeclared, which means I am not contributing to any potential consensus. Given that color 0 could yield a higher payoff if it could be achieved and my current connections lean towards color 1, it's clear I missed the opportunity to influence the network. Realistically, it seems all that can be done is to accept that I will not earn any payoff this round.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired once again, which means I cannot take any more actions. I am still undeclared, and I see that my connections predominantly lean towards color 1. There is a better projected reward for achieving a consensus for color 0, but without actionable steps taken


I have missed my opportunity to influence the outcome of the game. Since there won't be any payoff due to no consensus being reached


I need to accept this outcome.

**Agent**: 
Thought: The game time has expired again, meaning I cannot take any further actions. I'm still undeclared, and there are many connections I cannot influence since they have already committed to color 1. I have insufficient actions to secure a consensus for color 0, despite its higher projected payoff. As it stands


I have failed to utilize my opportunities, and I must accept that I will not earn any payoff this round because there was no consensus.
