Thought: Since I have no existing connections and my color is undeclared


I should start by purchasing a connection to another player. This will allow me to see their color in the next turn. Choosing a player with an available edge is essential to potentially influence the consensus towards my preferred color for a better payoff. However


I need to determine which player I can purchase an edge to. Since I have no connections


I will select a player with the lowest ID (other than myself) to maximize my chances of connecting to the network.
