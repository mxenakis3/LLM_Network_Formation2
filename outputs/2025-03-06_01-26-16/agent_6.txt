Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections in the network, and all nodes have an infinite shortest path distance. Since I can purchase edges to create connections


I should consider buying an edge to a neighbor. However, all nodes have a degree of 0 and are not connected to each other. My best option is to buy an edge to any available player to potentially develop a connection. The sooner I make a connection, the sooner I can understand the network configurations. I will choose to purchase an edge to player 0, since it is the first player in the node list.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have only one connection (to player 0) who has not declared their color yet. To increase my chances of achieving a consensus on color 0


I should consider purchasing connections to players who may also lean towards color 0. Since most players are distant (infinity path lengths)


I'll first purchase an edge to another connected player with a low distance. I'll look to purchase an edge if my best profit is currently with a consensus on color 0.
