Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth

**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections and cannot see any colors, but I need to establish a connection to potentially form a consensus. Since it's my first turn and all nodes have a degree of 0


I should purchase an edge to another player. This will allow me to see their color on the next turn. I will choose to connect to player 0, as they are the first agent in the network.
