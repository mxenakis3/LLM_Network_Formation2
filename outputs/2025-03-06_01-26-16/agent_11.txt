**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I have no connections and my shortest path distances indicate I can reach other players


I need to purchase an edge to start connecting with other agents. This will allow me to see their colors, which is essential for determining my next move regarding choosing a color. I will purchase an edge to any available player with the lowest ID to maximize my chance of forming connections.

**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to decide how to proceed in the game since my current state has only one connection (player 12) whose color is undeclared. I should aim for a consensus to maximize my payoff, and since the projected reward for a consensus of 1 is higher than for 0


I need to influence other players toward picking color 1. I can purchase new edges to find out more about other players' colors, but I'll need to weigh the potential of each new connection. 
Action: purchase_edge(12)  # I can only purchase an edge to player 12 at this time since it's the only connection I have.
