Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections as indicated by the empty colors dictionary. My only available connection is to agent 17, which is myself. Given that there are lower degrees of separation since I have no other connections


I can purchase an edge to connect with another player to increase my visibility in the game and potentially reach a consensus. Since I cannot see any colors


I should purchase an edge to increase my options. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)  # I'll attempt to purchase a connection to the first player.
