**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections, so I need to purchase an edge to another player in order to gain information on their color and potentially work towards a consensus. Since my shortest path distance suggests I can only connect to player 2


I should purchase an edge to them. 
Action: purchase_edge(2)
