**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any other players, as indicated by the empty colors dictionary. To have a chance at a consensus


I need to purchase edges to other players. Since all players have no current connections and their colors are undeclared


I should purchase edges to maximize my potential payoff. The players I can connect to are all players available in the degree and shortest path distance dictionaries. I will choose the player with the lowest ID, which is 0, to start connecting.
