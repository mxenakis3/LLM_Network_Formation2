**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently do not have any connections, so my colors dictionary is empty. I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player in order to see their color and possibly form a consensus. Since all players have a degree of 0 and I'm only connected to myself


I will have to deliberately choose a player to purchase an edge if possible. Given that I can't see anyone else


I’ll select a neighbor to connect to first. 
Action: purchase_edge(0)   # Purchase an edge to player 0 as an arbitrary choice.
