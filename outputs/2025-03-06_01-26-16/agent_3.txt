Thought: I have no existing connections to any players in the network, and since all players have a degree of 0


I need to purchase an edge to make a connection. I want to connect to any player to gain visibility of their colors and influence the consensus towards a higher projected payoff. I'll choose to purchase an edge to player 0, as they are the first option available.
