Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: Since I currently have no connections in the network


I need to purchase an edge to a neighboring agent to make my color visible and gather information about their color. This will help me decide on my strategy for maximizing my payoff. All other agents are currently undeclared, which does not provide any immediately useful information, so I should connect to another player. Action: purchase_edge(5)
