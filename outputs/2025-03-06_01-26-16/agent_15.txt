Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I currently have no connections to any players in the network, meaning I need to purchase edges to form connections. Since all players have a degree of 0, they are not connected to anyone. The best course of action is to purchase an edge to agent 16, as this will allow me to create a connection and potentially influence the color selection of the network.
