Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I have no existing connections since my colors dictionary is empty, which means I need to start purchasing edges to connect with other players in the network. I can purchase edges to any players, and I see that I can significantly increase my chances of winning if I can find players who might agree to a color consensus. Since there are no other players visible to me right now


I need to make a move to establish at least one connection.
Action: purchase_edge(2)  # I will buy an edge to player 2 as my first action.

Thought: I need to find the mass of Earth
Action: get_planet_mass(Earth)


**Agent**: 
Thought: I need to evaluate my current colors and the potential connections I can make based on the degree and shortest path distances. I see that both my current connections, 0 and 2, have undeclared colors. Since my projected reward for a consensus on color 1 is higher than that of color 0


I should consider securing more connections while trying to gauge the likelihood of achieving that consensus. I can purchase connections to other agents who are currently undeclared and might support my color. 
Action: purchase_edge(3)  # I'm choosing to buy a connection to player 3 since they are within my shortest path distance and undisclosed.
