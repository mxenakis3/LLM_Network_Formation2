Thought: I have no existing connections and my color is undeclared. To begin participating in the game


I need to purchase an edge to connect with another player. Since all players have infinite shortest path distances and degrees of 0


I can choose any player to connect with. I will start by purchasing an edge to player 0, as they're the first in the sequence.
