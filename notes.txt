Still have to:
-Get rid of react max iters
- Fix the graphing portions to make the graphs look better
  - Add in a proper assortativtity graph
  - Add in a proper SPL distribution graph
  - Clustering and transitivity
- Allow for node ID's to be randomly generated (to avoid getting power law distributions)
- Allow for initial network configuratons (ie. starting off with ER graphs)

Done
- JSON setups
- Fix state message to include up-to-date dictionaries from state.
- Find out why edges can be re-added (2,1) not treated as (1,2)
- Refactor so that we dont finish processing the action in agent loop but rather in process action
- Asynchronous agents

Hyperparameters
- The prompt (!!)
- The Model (!!)
- Temperature
- Max Tokens
